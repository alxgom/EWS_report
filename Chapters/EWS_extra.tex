\section{Other bifurcation ideas}


Given a system with two wels, and some white noise from an stochastic system, the time to scape from each well is given by the 
Kramers time\cite{...}: $\tau=c\, e^{2\Delta U/\sigma_s^2}$, where $U$ is the wall height of the well, ans sigma is the variance of the system in the well\textcolor{red}{i'm not os sure about that}, the it's possible to calculate the average time to bifurcation and the time spent on each equilibrium.
