abstract = {We discuss the nonlinear phenomena of irreversible tipping for non-autonomous systems where time-varying inputs correspond to a smooth 'parameter shift' from one asymptotic value to another. We express tipping in terms of properties of local pullback attractors and present some results on how nontrivial dynamics for non-autonomous systems can be deduced from analysis of the bifurcation diagram for an associated autonomous system where parameters are fixed. In particular, we show that there is a unique local pullback point attractor associated with each linearly stable equilibrium for the past limit. If there is a smooth stable branch of equilibria over the range of values of the parameter shift, the pullback attractor will remain close to (track) this branch for small enough rates, though larger rates may lead to rate-induced tipping. More generally, we show that one can track certain stable paths that go along several stable branches by pseudo-orbits of the system, for small enough rates. For these local pullback point attractors, we define notions of bifurcation-induced and irreversible rate-induced tipping of the non-autonomous system. In one-dimension, we introduce the notion of forward basin stability and use this to give a number of sufficient conditions for the presence or absence of rate-induced tipping. We apply our results to give criteria for irreversible rate-induced tipping in a conceptual climate model.},

abstract = {AbstractThe recent description of potentially generic early warning signals is a promising development that may help conservationists to anticipate a population's collapse prior to its occurrence. So far, the majority of such warning signals documented have been in highly controlled laboratory systems or in theoretical models. Data from wild populations, however, are typically restricted both temporally and spatially due to limited monitoring resources and intrinsic ecological heterogeneity—limitations that may affect the detectability of generic early warning signals, as they add additional stochasticity to population abundance estimates. Consequently, spatial and temporal subsampling may serve to either muffle or magnify early warning signals. Using a combination of theoretical models and analysis of experimental data, we evaluate the extent to which statistical warning signs are robust to data corruption.},

Higher-order N-soliton solutions with N=2, 3 are studied in detail and shown to be associated with self-focusing in the wave group dynamics and the generation of a steep localized carrier wave underneath the group envelope. We also show that for larger input soliton numbers, the wave group experiences irreversible spectral broadening, which we refer to as a hydrodynamic supercontinuum by analogy with optics. This process is shown to be associated with the fission of the initial multisoliton into individual fundamental solitons due to higher-order nonlinear perturbations to the NLS. Numerical simulations using an extended NLS model described by the modified nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation, show excellent agreement with experiment and highlight the universal role that higher-order nonlinear perturbations to the NLS play in supercontinuum generation. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is exploited to determine the global stability threshold Rg of plane Couette flow - the flow of a viscous fluid in the space between two parallel plates - whose laminar or turbulent behavior depends on the Reynolds number R. Even if the existence of a global stability threshold has been detected in simulations and experiments, its numerical value has not been unequivocally defined. Rg is the value such that for R>Rg, turbulence is sustained, whereas for R<Rg it is transient and eventually decays. We address the problem of determining R g by using the extremes - maxima and minima - of the perturbation energy fluctuations. When R≫Rg, both the positive and negative extremes are bounded. As the critical Reynolds number is approached from above, the probability of observing a very low minimum increases causing asymmetries in the distributions of maxima and minima. On the other hand, the maxima distribution is unaffected as the fluctuations towards higher values of the perturbation energy remain bounded. This tipping point can be detected by fitting the data to the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution and by identifying Rg as the value of R such that the shape parameter of the GEV for the minima changes sign from negative to positive. The results are supported by the analysis of theoretical models which feature a bistable behavior. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Vanselow2019,
abstract = {Critical transitions or regime shifts are sudden and unexpected changes in the state of an ecosystem, that are usually associated with dangerous levels of environmental change. However, recent studies show that critical transitions can also be triggered by dangerous rates of environmental change. In contrast to classical regime shifts, such rate-induced critical transitions do not involve any obvious loss of stability, or a bifurcation, and thus cannot be explained by the linear stability analysis. In this work, we demonstrate that the well-known Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model can undergo a rate-induced critical transition in response to a continuous decline in the habitat quality, resulting in a collapse of the predator and prey populations. Rather surprisingly, the collapse occurs even if the environmental change is slower than the slowest process in the model. To explain this counterintuitive phenomenon, we combine methods from geometric singular perturbation theory with the concept of a moving equilibrium, and study critical rates of environmental change with dependence on the initial state and the system parameters. Moreover, for a fixed rate of environmental change, we determine the set of initial states that undergo a rate-induced population collapse. Our results suggest that ecosystems may be more sensitive to how fast environmental conditions change than previously assumed. In particular, unexpected critical transitions with dramatic ecological consequences can be triggered by environmental changes that (i) do not exceed any dangerous levels, and (ii) are slower than the natural timescales of the ecosystem. This poses an interesting research question whether regime shifts observed in the natural world are predominantly rate-induced or bifurcation-induced.},

In particular, the physical study of the avian vocal organ can help to elucidate which features found in the song of birds are under direct control of specific neural instructions and which emerge from the biomechanics involved in its generation.

Such critical thresholds have been suggested to exist for the disappearance of Arctic sea ice and the retreat of ice sheets: Once these ice masses have shrunk below an anticipated critical extent, the ice-albedo feedback might lead to the irreversible and unstoppable loss of the remaining ice. We here give an overview of our current understanding of such threshold behavior. By using conceptual arguments, we review the recent findings that such a tipping point probably does not exist for the loss of Arctic summer sea ice. Hence, in a cooler climate, sea ice could recover rapidly from the loss it has experienced in recent years. In addition, we discuss why this recent rapid retreat of Arctic summer sea ice might largely be a consequence of a slow shift in ice-thickness distribution, which will lead to strongly increased year-to-year variability of the Arctic summer sea-ice extent. This variability will render seasonal forecasts of the Arctic summer seaice extent increasingly difficult.We also discuss why, in contrast to Arctic summer sea ice, a tipping point is more likely to exist for the loss of the Greenland ice sheet and the West Antarctic ice sheet.},

Current global warming of ∼1.1°C above preindustrial temperatures already lies within the lower end of some tipping point uncertainty ranges. Several tipping points may be triggered in the Paris Agreement range of 1.5 to <2°C global warming, with many more likely at the 2 to 3°C of warming expected on current policy trajectories. This strengthens the evidence base for urgent action to mitigate climate change and to develop improved tipping point risk assessment, early warning capability, and adaptation strategies.},

abstract = {There is currently much interest in examining climatic tipping points, to see if it is feasible to predict them in advance. Using techniques from bifurcation theory, recent work looks for a slowing down of the intrinsic transient responses, which is predicted to occur before an instability is encountered. This is done, for example, by determining the short-term autocorrelation coefficient ARC(1) in a sliding window of the time-series: this stability coefficient should increase to unity at tipping. Such studies have been made both on climatic computer models and on real paleoclimate data preceding ancient tipping events. The latter employ reconstituted time-series provided by ice cores, sediments, etc., and seek to establish whether the actual tipping could have been accurately predicted in advance. One such example is the end of the Younger Dryas event, about 11 500 years ago, when the Arctic warmed by 7°C in 50 yrs. A second gives an excellent prediction for the end of "greenhouse" Earth about 34 million years ago when the climate tipped from a tropical state into an icehouse state, using data from tropical Pacific sediment cores. This prediction science is very young, but some encouraging results are already being obtained. Future analyses will clearly need to embrace both real data from improved monitoring instruments, and simulation data generated from increasingly sophisticated predictive models. {\textcopyright} 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Three regimes are found for the wind-viscosity balance: we classify them according to the attractor in the phase-plane of the degenerate four-wave mixing truncated system and to the shift of the spectral mean. Downshift can coexist with both forcing and damping, i.e. attraction to period-1 or period-2 solutions. Upshift is associated to stronger winds, i.e. to a net forcing where the attractor is always a period-1 solution.

abstract = {Many complex systems undergo critical transitions. A thermoacoustic system is one such system which exhibits a catastrophic transition to a state of oscillatory instability known as thermoacoustic instability. So far, several early warning signals have been devised to detect the transition from stable operation to thermoacoustic instability in both laminar and turbulent systems. We focus on these early warning signals, and the challenges faced while detecting oscillatory instabilities in practical systems. In contrast to the transition from a fixed point to limit cycle oscillations in laminar systems, turbulent systems exhibit a transition from a chaotic state to limit cycle via a state of intermittency. In this review, we highlight the importance of the inherent fluctuations in the system in providing early warning signals for critical transitions.},

abstract = {Early warning signals (EWSs) have the potential to predict tipping points where catastrophic changes occur in ecological systems. However, EWSs are plagued by false negatives, leading to undetected catastrophes. One reason may be because EWSs do not occur equally for all species in a system, so whether and how strongly EWSs are detected depends on which species is being observed. Here, we illustrate how the strength of EWSs is determined by each species' relationship to properties of the noise, the system's response to that noise, and the occurrence of critical slowing down (the dynamical phenomenon that gives rise to EWSs). Using these relationships, we present general rules for maximizing EWS detection in ecological communities. We find that for two-species competitive and mutualistic systems, one should generally monitor the species experiencing smaller intraspecific effects to maximize EWS performance, while in consumer-resource systems, one should monitor the species imposing the smaller interspecific effects. These guidelines appear to hold for at least some larger communities as well. We close by extending the theoretical basis for our rules to systems with any number of species and more complex forms of noise. Our findings provide important guidance on how to monitor systems for EWSs to maximize detection of tipping points.},

abstract = {We study the behavior at tipping points close to non-smooth fold bifurcations in non-autonomous systems. The focus is the Stommel-Box, and related climate models, which are piecewise-smooth continuous dynamical systems, modeling thermohaline circulation. We obtain explicit asymptotic expressions for the behavior at tipping points in the settings of both slowly varying freshwater forcing and rapidly oscillatory fluctuations. The results, based on combined multiple scale and local analyses, provide conditions for the sudden transitions between temperature-dominated and salinity-dominated states. In the context of high frequency oscillations, a multiple scale averaging approach can be used instead of the usual geometric approach normally required for piecewise-smooth continuous systems. The explicit parametric dependencies of advances and lags in the tipping show a competition between dynamic features of the model. We make a contrast between the behavior of tipping points close to both smooth Saddle–Node Bifurcations and the non-smooth systems studied on this paper. In particular we show that the non-smooth case has earlier and more abrupt transitions. This result has clear implications for the design of early warning signals for tipping in the case of the non-smooth dynamical systems which often arise in climate models.},

abstract = {There is currently much interest in examining climatic tipping points, to see if it is feasible to predict them in advance. Using techniques from bifurcation theory, recent work looks for a slowing down of the intrinsic transient responses, which is predicted to occur before an instability is encountered. This is done, for example, by determining the short-term autocorrelation coefficient ARC(1) in a sliding window of the time-series: this stability coefficient should increase to unity at tipping. Such studies have been made both on climatic computer models and on real paleoclimate data preceding ancient tipping events. The latter employ reconstituted time-series provided by ice cores, sediments, etc., and seek to establish whether the actual tipping could have been accurately predicted in advance. One such example is the end of the Younger Dryas event, about 11 500 years ago, when the Arctic warmed by 7°C in 50 yrs. A second gives an excellent prediction for the end of "greenhouse" Earth about 34 million years ago when the climate tipped from a tropical state into an icehouse state, using data from tropical Pacific sediment cores. This prediction science is very young, but some encouraging results are already being obtained. Future analyses will clearly need to embrace both real data from improved monitoring instruments, and simulation data generated from increasingly sophisticated predictive models. {\textcopyright} 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract = {Background: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex disease and harmful to human health, and most of the existing biomarkers are mainly to measure the disease phenotype after the disease onset (or drastic deterioration). Until now, there is no effective biomarker which can predict the upcoming disease (or pre-disease state) before disease onset or disease deterioration. Further, the detail molecular mechanism for such deterioration of the disease, e.g., driver genes or causal network of the disease, is still unclear. Methods. In this study, we detected early-warning signals of T1D and its leading biomolecular networks based on serial gene expression profiles of NOD (non-obese diabetic) mice by identifying a new type of biomarker, i.e., dynamical network biomarker (DNB) which forms a specific module for marking the time period just before the drastic deterioration of T1D. Results: Two dynamical network biomarkers were obtained to signal the emergence of two critical deteriorations for the disease, and could be used to predict the upcoming sudden changes during the disease progression. We found that the two critical transitions led to peri-insulitis and hyperglycemia in NOD mices, which are consistent with other independent experimental results from literature. Conclusions: The identified dynamical network biomarkers can be used to detect the early-warning signals of T1D and predict upcoming disease onset before the drastic deterioration. In addition, we also demonstrated that the leading biomolecular networks are causally related to the initiation and progression of T1D, and provided the biological insight into the molecular mechanism of T1D. Experimental data from literature and functional analysis on DNBs validated the computational results. {\textcopyright} 2013 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Stochastic averaging allows for the reduction of the dimension and complexity of stochastic dynamical systems with multiple time scales, replacing fast variables with statistically equivalent stochastic processes in order to analyze variables evolving on the slow time scale. These procedures have been studied extensively for systems driven by Gaussian noise, but very little attention has been given to the case of $\alpha$-stable noise forcing which arises naturally from heavy-tailed stochastic perturbations. In this paper, we study nonlinear fast-slow stochastic dynamical systems in which the fast variables are driven by additive $\alpha$-stable noise perturbations and the slow variables depend linearly on the fast variables. Using a combination of perturbation methods and Fourier analysis, we derive stochastic averaging approximations for the statistical contributions of the fast variables to the slow variables. In the case that the diffusion term of the reduced model depends on the state of the slow variable, we show that this term is interpreted in terms of the Marcus calculus. For the case $\alpha$ = 2, which corresponds to Gaussian noise, the results are consistent with previous results for stochastic averaging in the Gaussian case. Although the main results are derived analytically for 1 < $\alpha$ < 2, we provide evidence of their validity for $\alpha$ < 1 with numerical examples. We numerically simulate both linear and nonlinear systems and the corresponding reduced models, demonstrating good agreement for their stationary distributions and temporal dependence properties.},

One of the examples was the tsunami that occurred in the Indian Ocean on 26 December 2004. This indicates how important it is for us to fully understand water waves, in particular the very large ones. One way to do so is to perform numerical simulation based on the nonlinear theory. Considerable research advances have been made in this area over the past decade by developing various numerical methods and applying them to emerging problems; however, until now there has been no comprehensive book to reflect these advances. This unique volume aims to bridge this gap. This book contains 18 self-contained chapters written by more than 50 authors from 12 different countries, many of whom are world-leading experts in the field. Each chapter is based mainly on the pioneering work of the authors and their research teams over the past decades. The chapters altogether deal with almost all numerical methods that have been employed so far to simulate nonlinear water waves and cover many important and very interesting applications, such as overturning waves, breaking waves, waves generated by landslides, freak waves, solitary waves, tsunamis, sloshing waves, interaction of extreme waves with beaches, interaction with fixed structures, and interaction with free-response floating structures. Therefore, this book provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art research and key achievements in numerical modeling of nonlinear water waves, and serves as a unique reference for postgraduates, researchers and senior engineers working in industry.},

Based on a low-dimensional approximation obtained by considering only three complex harmonic modes, we discuss how to stabilize a one-dimensional pattern in the form of train of large peaks sitting on a background and propagating over a significant distance. Our approach is based on a gradual depth variation, while its conceptual framework is the theory of autoresonance in nonlinear systems and leads to a quasi-frozen state. Three main stages are identified: amplification from small sideband amplitudes, separatrix crossing and adiabatic conversion to orbits oscillating around an elliptic fixed point. Analytical estimates on the three stages are obtained from the low-dimensional approximation and validated by NLSE simulations.

abstract = {Campaigns to eliminate infectious diseases could be greatly aided by methods for providing early warning signals of resurgence. Theory predicts that as a disease transmission system undergoes a transition from stability at the disease-free equilibrium to sustained transmission, it will exhibit characteristic behaviours known as critical slowing down, referring to the speed at which fluctuations in the number of cases are dampened, for instance the extinction of a local transmission chain after infection from an imported case. These phenomena include increases in several summary statistics, including lag-1 autocorrelation, variance and the first difference of variance. Here, we report the first empirical test of this prediction during the resurgence of malaria in Kericho, Kenya. For 10 summary statistics, we measured the approach to criticality in a rolling window to quantify the size of effect and directions. Nine of the statistics increased as predicted and variance, the first difference of variance, autocovariance, lag-1 autocorrelation and decay time returned early warning signals of critical slowing down based on permutation tests. These results show that time series of disease incidence collected through ordinary surveillance activities may exhibit characteristic signatures prior to an outbreak, a phenomenon that may be quite general among infectious disease systems.},

@article{Ashwin,
abstract = {The Quaternary period has been characterised by a cyclical series of glaciations, which are attributed to the change in the insolation (incoming solar radiation) from changes in the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The spectral power in the climate record is very different from that of the orbital forcing: prior to 1000 kyr before present most of the spectral power is in the 41 kyr band while since then the power has been in the 100 kyr band. The change defines the middle Pleistocene transition (MPT). The MPT does not indicate any noticeable difference in the orbital forcing. The climate response to the insolation is thus far from linear, and appears to be structurally different before and after the MPT. This paper presents a low order conceptual model for the oscillatory dynamics of the ice sheets in terms of a relaxation oscillator with multiple levels subject to the Milankovitch forcing. The model exhibits smooth transitions between three different climate states; an interglacial (i), a mild glacial (g) and a deep glacial (G) as proposed by Paillard (Nature 391:378–381, 1998). The model suggests a dynamical explanation in terms of the structure of a slow manifold for the observed allowed and “forbidden” transitions between the three climate states. With the model, the pacing of the climate oscillations by the astronomical forcing is through the mechanism of phase-resetting of relaxation oscillations in which the internal phase of the oscillation is affected by the forcing. In spite of its simplicity as a forced ODE, the model is able to reproduce not only general features but also many of the details of oscillations observed in the climate record. A particular novelty is that it includes a slow drift in the form of the slow manifold that reproduces the observed dynamical change at the MPT. We explain this change in terms of a transcritical bifurcation in the fast dynamics on varying the slow variable; this bifurcation can induce a sudden change in periodicity and amplitude of the cycle and we suggest that this is associated with a branch of “canard oscillations” that appear for a small range of parameters. The model is remarkably robust at simulating the climate record before, during and after the MPT. Even though the conceptual model does not point to specific mechanisms, the physical implication is that the major reorganisation of the climate response to the orbital forcing does not necessarily imply that there was a big change in the environmental conditions.},

abstract = {The availability of time series of the evolution of the properties of physical systems is increasing, stimulating the development of many novel methods for the extraction of information about their behaviour over time, including whether or not they arise from deterministic or stochastic dynamical systems. Surrogate data testing is an essential part of many of these methods, as it enables robust statistical evaluations to ensure that the results observed are not obtained by chance, but are a true characteristic of the underlying system. The surrogate data technique is based on the comparison of a particular property of the data (a discriminating statistic) with the distribution of the same property calculated in a set of constructed signals (surrogates) which match the original data set but do not possess the property that is being tested. Fourier transform based surrogates remain the most popular, yet many more options have since been developed to test increasingly varied null hypotheses while characterizing the dynamics of complex systems, including uncorrelated and correlated noise, coupling between systems, and synchronization. Here, we provide a detailed overview of a wide range of surrogate types, discuss their practical applications and demonstrate their use in both numerically simulated and real experimental systems. We also compare the performance of various surrogate types for the detection of nonlinearity, synchronization and coherence, coupling strength between systems, and the nature of coupling. A MatLab toolbox for many of the surrogate methods is provided.},

abstract = {Early detection of bifurcations and chaos and understanding their topological characteristics are essential for safe and reliable operation of various electrical, chemical, physical, and industrial processes. However, the presence of non-linearity and high-dimensionality in system behavior makes this analysis a challenging task. The existing methods for dynamical system analysis provide useful tools for anomaly detection (e.g., Bendixson-Dulac and Poincare-Bendixson criteria can detect the presence of limit cycles); however, they do not provide a detailed topological understanding about system evolution during bifurcations and chaos, such as the changes in the number of subcycles and their positions, lifetimes, and sizes. This paper addresses this research gap by using topological data analysis as a tool to study system evolution and develop a mathematical framework for detecting the topological changes in the underlying system using persistent homology. Using the proposed technique, topological features (e.g., number of relevant k-dimensional holes, etc.) are extracted from nonlinear time series data which are useful for deeper analysis of the system behavior and early detection of bifurcations and chaos. When applied to a Logistic map, a Duffing oscillator, and a real life Op-amp based Jerk circuit, these features are shown to accurately characterize the system dynamics and detect the onset of chaos.

abstract = {Mutualistic systems can experience abrupt and irreversible regime shifts caused by local or global stressors. Despite decades of efforts to understand ecosystem dynamics and determine whether a tipping point could occur, there are no current approaches to estimate distances (in state/parameter space) to tipping points and compare the distances across various mutualistic systems. Here we develop a general dimension-reduction approach that simultaneously compresses the natural control and state parameters of high-dimensional complex systems and introduces a scaling factor for recovery rates. Our theoretical framework places various systems with entirely different dynamical parameters, network structure and state perturbations on the same scale. More importantly, it compares distances to tipping points across different systems on the basis of data on abundance and topology. By applying the method to 54 real-world mutualistic networks, our analytical results unveil the network characteristics and system parameters that control a system's resilience. We contribute to the ongoing efforts in developing a general framework for mapping and predicting distance to tipping points of ecological and potentially other systems.},

abstract = {Amazon forest dieback is seen as a potential tipping point under climate change. These concerns are partly based-on an early coupled climate-carbon cycle simulation, that produced unusually strong drying and warming in Amazonia. In contrast, the 5th generation Earth System Models (CMIP5) produced few examples of Amazon dieback under climate change. Here we examine results from seven 6th generation models (CMIP6) which include vegetation dynamics, and in some cases interactive forest fires. Although these models typically project increases in area-mean forest carbon across Amazonia under CO2-induced climate change, five of the seven models also produce abrupt reductions in vegetation carbon which indicate localised dieback events. The Northern South America region (NSA), which contains most of the rainforest, is especially vulnerable in the models. These dieback events, some of which are mediated by fire, are preceded by an increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in near surface temperature, which is consistent with more extreme dry seasons. Based-on the ensemble mean of the detected dieback events we estimate that 7 +/-5% of the NSA region will experience abrupt downward shifts in vegetation carbon per degree of global warming above 1.5 degrees.},

abstract = {Research on the possibility of future abrupt climate change has been popularized under the term 'tipping points' and has often been motivated by using simple, low-dimensional concepts. These include the iconic fold bifurcation, where abrupt change occurs when a stable equilibrium is lost, and early warning signals of such a destabilization that can be derived based on a simple stochastic model approach. In this paper, we review the challenges and limitations that are associated with this view, and we discuss promising research paths to explore the causes and the likelihood of abrupt changes in future climate. We focus on several climate system components and ecosystems that have been proposed as candidates for tipping points, with an emphasis on ice sheets, the Atlantic Ocean circulation, vegetation in North Africa and Arctic sea ice. In most example cases, multiple equilibria found in simple models do not appear in complex models or become more difficult to find, while the potential for abrupt change still remains. We also discuss how the low-dimensional logic of current methods to detect and interpret the existence of multiple equilibria can fail in complex models. Moreover, we highlight promising methods to detect abrupt shifts and to obtain information about the mechanisms behind them. These methods include linear approaches such as statistical stability indicators and radiative feedback analysis as well as non-linear approaches to detect dynamical transitions and infer the causality behind events. Given the huge complexity of comprehensive process-based climate models and the non-linearity and regional peculiarities of the processes involved, the uncertainties associated with the possible future occurrence of abrupt shifts are large and not well quantified. We highlight the potential of},

In particular, the ordinal method defines sequences of symbols according to the ordering in which values appear in a time series. This method has been shown to yield useful information, even when applied to signals with large noise contamination. Here, we use ordinal analysis to investigate the transition between eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) resting states. We analyze two electroencephalography datasets (with 71 and 109 healthy subjects) with different recording conditions (sampling rates and the number of electrodes in the scalp). Using as diagnostic tools the permutation entropy, the entropy computed from symbolic transition probabilities, and an asymmetry coefficient (that measures the asymmetry of the likelihood of the transitions between symbols), we show that the ordinal analysis applied to the raw data distinguishes the two brain states. In both datasets, we find that, during the EC-EO transition, the EO state is characterized by higher entropies and lower asymmetry coefficient, as compared to the EC state. Our results thus show that these diagnostic tools have the potential for detecting and characterizing changes in time-evolving brain states.},

abstract = {The scientific study of complex systems has transformed a wide range of disciplines in recent years, enabling researchers in both the natural and social sciences to model and predict phenomena as diverse as earthquakes, global warming, demographic patterns, financial crises, and the failure of materials. In this book, Didier Sornette boldly applies his varied experience in these areas to propose a simple, powerful, and general theory of how, why, and when stock markets crash. Most attempts to explain market failures seek to pinpoint triggering mechanisms that occur hours, days, or weeks before the collapse. Sornette proposes a radically different view: the underlying cause can be sought months and even years before the abrupt, catastrophic event in the build-up of cooperative speculation, which often translates into an accelerating rise of the market price, otherwise known as a "bubble." Anchoring his sophisticated, step-by-step analysis in leading-edge physical and statistical modeling techniques, he unearths remarkable insights and some predictions--among them, that the "end of the growth era" will occur around 2050. Sornette probes major historical precedents, from the decades-long "tulip mania" in the Netherlands that wilted suddenly in 1637 to the South Sea Bubble that ended with the first huge market crash in England in 1720, to the Great Crash of October 1929 and Black Monday in 1987, to cite just a few. He concludes that most explanations other than cooperative self-organization fail to account for the subtle bubbles by which the markets lay the groundwork for catastrophe. Any investor or investment professional who seeks a genuine understanding of looming financial disasters should read this book. Physicists, geologists, biologists, economists, and others will welcome Why Stock Markets Crash as a highly original "scientific tale," as Sornette aptly puts it, of the exciting and sometimes fearsome--but no longer quite so unfathomable--world of stock markets.},

abstract = {In the age of climate warming, comprehension of ecosystems' future is one of the pressing challenges to humanity. While most studies on climate warming focus on the 'magnitude of change' of the Earth's temperature, the 'rate' at which it is increasing cannot be ruled out. Rapid warming has already caused sudden ecosystem transitions at numerous biodiversity hot spots; a mechanistic understanding of such transitions is crucial. Here, we study a slow-fast consumer-resource ecosystem interacting in rapid warming scenarios. Employing geometric singular perturbation theory, we find that while a gradual change in mean temperature may accord population persistence, a critical warming rate can drive the resource's sudden collapse, termed a warming-induced abrupt transition. This further triggers the bottom-up effect, resulting in the extinction of the consumer. The difference between the optimum temperature of the resource's growth rate and the habitat temperature is crucial in deciding the critical rate of warming. Consequently, species inhabiting extreme temperature regions are more susceptible to warming-induced collapse than those within intermediate temperature ranges. We find that stochastic fluctuations in the system can advance warming-induced transitions, and the efficacy of generic early warning signals to anticipate sudden transitions is challenged.},

The acquisition functions introduced in this work leverage the properties of the likelihood ratio, a quantity that acts as a probabilistic sampling weight and guides the active-learning algorithm toward regions of the input space that are deemed most relevant.

One must add an additional term-the 'Stokes velocity' which depends also on the time and distance scales of the fluctuating currents. In typical circumstances, where the fluctuations are larger than the mean current, the Stokes velocity may dominate the mass transport, and lead to the mass transport being opposite in direction to the mean current. Some general expressions are given for the Stokes velocity, and these are studied in detail for the particular case of waves propagated along a sloping sea bed (double Kelvin waves). Such waves are always propagated with the shallower water to their right in the northern hemisphere. It is shown that in regions of small bottom gradient the Stokes velocity is in the same direction as the phase velocity, but in the region of large bottom gradient the sign of the Stokes velocity is reversed. The mean Stokes velocity is in the direction of wave propagation. However, the total transport (integrated with respect to the depth and width) is in the opposite direction. {\textcopyright} 1969.},

abstract = {In financial markets, participants locally optimize their profit which can result in a globally unstable state leading to a catastrophic change. The largest crash in the past decades is the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers which was followed by a trust-based crisis between banks due to high-risk trading in complex products. We introduce information dissipation length (IDL) as a leading indicator of global instability of dynamical systems based on the transmission of Shannon information and apply it to the time series of USD and EUR interest rate swaps (IRS). We find in both markets that the IDL steadily increases toward the bankruptcy, then peaks at the time of bankruptcy and decreases afterwards. Previously introduced indicators such as `critical slowing down' do not provide a clear leading indicator. Our results suggest that the IDL may be used as an early-warning signal for critical transitions even in the absence of a predictive model.},

abstract = {The field of nonlinear dispersive waves has developed enormously since the work of Stokes, Boussinesq and Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) in the nineteenth century. In the 1960s, researchers developed effective asymptotic methods for deriving nonlinear wave equations, such as the KdV equation, governing a broad class of physical phenomena that admit special solutions including those commonly known as solitons. This book describes the underlying approximation techniques and methods for finding solutions to these and other equations. The concepts and methods covered include wave dispersion, asymptotic analysis, perturbation theory, the method of multiple scales, deep and shallow water waves, nonlinear optics including fiber optic communications, mode-locked lasers and dispersion-managed wave phenomena. Most chapters feature exercise sets, making the book suitable for advanced courses or for self-directed learning. Graduate students and researchers will find this an excellent entry to a thriving area at the intersection of applied mathematics, engineering and physical science.},

abstract = {Catastrophic regime shifts in complex natural systems may be averted through advanced detection. Recent work has provided a proof-of-principle that many systems approaching a catastrophic transition may be identified through the lens of early warning indicators such as rising variance or increased return times. Despite widespread appreciation of the difficulties and uncertainty involved in such forecasts, proposed methods hardly ever characterize their expected error rates. Without the benefits of replicates, controls or hindsight, applications of these approaches must quantify how reliable different indicators are in avoiding false alarms, and how sensitive they are to missing subtle warning signs. We propose a model-based approach to quantify this trade-off between reliability and sensitivity and allow comparisons between different indicators. We show these error rates can be quite severe for common indicators even under favourable assumptions, and also illustrate how a model-based indicator can improve this performance. We demonstrate how the performance of an early warning indicator varies in different datasets, and suggest that uncertainty quantification become a more central part of early warning predictions. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Laser filamentation in gases is often carried out in the laboratory with focusing optics to better stabilize the filament, whereas real-world applications of filaments frequently involve collimated or near-collimated beams. It is well documented that geometrical focusing can alter the properties of laser filaments and, consequently, a transition between a collimated and a strongly focused filament is expected. Nevertheless, this transition point has not been identified. Here, we propose an analytical method to determine the transition, and show that it corresponds to an actual shift in the balance of physical mechanisms governing filamentation. In high-NA conditions, filamentation is primarily governed by geometrical focusing and plasma effects, while the Kerr nonlinearity plays a more significant role as NA decreases. We find the transition between the two regimes to be relatively insensitive to the intrinsic laser parameters, and our analysis agrees well with a wide range of parameters found in published literature.},

abstract = {There is a long history in ecology of using mathematical models to identify deterministic processes that may lead to dramatic population dynamic patterns like boom-and-bust outbreaks. Stochasticity is also well-known to have a significant influence on the dynamics of many ecological systems, but this aspect has received far less attention. Here, we study a stochastic version of a classic bistable insect outbreak model to reveal the role of stochasticity in generating outbreak dynamics. We find that stochasticity has strong effects on the dynamics and that the stochastic system can behave in ways that are not easily anticipated by its deterministic counterpart. Both the intensity and autocorrelation of the stochastic environment are important. Stochasticity with higher intensity (variability) generally weakens bistability, causing the dynamics to spend more time at a single state rather than jumping between alternative stable states. Which state the population tends toward depends on the noise color. High-intensity white noise causes the insect population to spend more time at low density, potentially reducing the severity or frequency of outbreaks. However, red (positively autocorrelated) noise can make the population spend more time near the high density state, intensifying outbreaks. Under neither type of noise do early warning signals reliably predict impending outbreaks or population crashes.},

Either reduced resilience or increased external fluctuations can tip ecosystems to an alternative stable state. It is shown that changes in asymmetry in the distribution of time series data, quantified by changing skewness, is a model-independent and reliable early warning signal for both routes to regime shifts. Furthermore, using model simulations that mimic field measurements and a simple analysis of real data from abrupt climate change in the Sahara, we study the feasibility of skewness calculations using data available from routine monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the influence of random noise on route to chaos followed by directly modulated laser diode as we found that is more complex than just a Feigenbaum sequence. We have already shown that when the laser is modulated at twice its resonance frequency and the modulation index is increased, a period tripling stable solution coexists with the Feigenbaum sequence for certain values of the modulation index, giving rise to hysteresis loops and chaotic bifurcations. This coexistence gives the noise a relevant role in determining the dynamic behavior. We have studied the route to chaos of the laser diode when the random noise fluctuations are introduced in the model. For this study, we have used three different numerical methods. We have employed a single step fourth order Runge- Kutta algorithm, which has been commonly used in previous studies, and its results have been compared to those provided by two stochastic integration methods: Euler- Maruyama and a stochastic Heun method. In all three cases, the behavior evolves from the single periodic response through period doubling, period quadrupling and period tripling in accordance with recent experimental studies, showing that in the route to chaos, the period doubling sequence is effectively truncated due to random noise. The reason for the truncation is found in the nearby coexisting period three solution. Nevertheless, the Runge-Kutta algorithm smoothes off the random noise fluctuations, probably due to its large correlation time. {\textcopyright}2003 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.},

Superimposed on these long glacial cycles comes an intricate pattern of millennial and sub-millennial variability, including Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich events. There are numerous theories about these oscillations. Here, we review a number of them in order to draw a parallel between climatic concepts and dynamical system concepts, including, in particular, the relaxation oscillator, excitability, slow-fast dynamics and homoclinic orbits. Namely, almost all theories of ice ages reviewed here feature a phenomenon of synchronization between internal climate dynamics and astronomical forcing. However, these theories differ in their bifurcation structure and this has an effect on the way the ice age phenomenon could grow 3 Ma ago. All theories on rapid events reviewed here rely on the concept of a limit cycle excited by changes in the surface freshwater balance of the ocean. The article also reviews basic effects of stochastic fluctuations on these models, including the phenomenon of phase dispersion, shortening of the limit cycle and stochastic resonance. It concludes with a more personal statement about the potential for inference with simple stochastic dynamical systems in palaeoclimate science. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society.},

We describe the research done on generic abundance-based signals of instability that are derived from the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which represent the genesis of EWSs research. We highlight some of the issues facing the detection of such signals in biological systems – which are inherently complex and show low signal-to-noise ratios. We then document research on alternative signals of instability, including measuring shifts in spatial autocorrelation and trait dynamics, and discuss potential future directions for EWSs research based on detailed demographic and phenotypic data. We set EWSs research in the greater field of predictive ecology and weigh up the costs and benefits of simplicity vs. complexity in predictive models, and how the available data should steer the development of future methods. Finally, we identify some key unanswered questions that, if solved, could improve the applicability of these methods.},

abstract = {In this paper we provide a connection between the geometrical properties of the attractor of a chaotic dynamical system and the distribution of extreme values. We show that the extremes of so-called physical observables are distributed according to the classical generalised Pareto distribution and derive explicit expressions for the scaling and the shape parameter. In particular, we derive that the shape parameter does not depend on the chosen observables, but only on the partial dimensions of the invariant measure on the stable, unstable, and neutral manifolds. The shape parameter is negative and is close to zero when high-dimensional systems are considered. This result agrees with what was derived recently using the generalized extreme value approach. Combining the results obtained using such physical observables and the properties of the extremes of distance observables, it is possible to derive estimates of the partial dimensions of the attractor along the stable and the unstable directions of the flow. Moreover, by writing the shape parameter in terms of moments of the extremes of the considered observable and by using linear response theory, we relate the sensitivity to perturbations of the shape parameter to the sensitivity of the moments, of the partial dimensions, and of the Kaplan-Yorke dimension of the attractor. Preliminary numerical investigations provide encouraging results on the applicability of the theory presented here. The results presented here do not apply for all combinations of Axiom A systems and observables, but the breakdown seems to be related to very special geometrical configurations. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s).},

abstract = {In this study, a new market representation from persistence homology, known as the L1-norm time series, is used and applied independently with three critical slowing down indicators [autocorrelation function at lag 1, variance, and mean for power spectrum (MPS)] to examine two historical financial crises (Dotcom crash and Lehman Brothers bankruptcy) in the US market. The captured signal is the rising trend in the indicator time series, which can be determined by Kendall's tau correlation test. Furthermore, we examined Pearson's and Spearman's rho correlation tests as potential substitutes for Kendall's tau correlation. After that, we determined a correlation threshold and predicted the whole available date. The point of comparison between these correlation tests is to determine which test is significant and consistent in classifying the rising trend. The results of such a comparison will suggest the best test that can classify the observed rising trend and detect early warning signals (EWSs) of impending financial crises. Our outcome shows that the L1-norm time series is more likely to increase before the two financial crises. Kendall's tau, Pearson's, and Spearman's rho correlation tests consistently indicate a significant rising trend in the MPS time series before the two financial crises. Based on the two evaluation scores (the probability of successful anticipation and probability of erroneous anticipation), by using the L1-norm time series with MPS, our result in the whole prediction demonstrated that Spearman's rho correlation (46.15 and 53.85%) obtains the best score as compared to Kendall's tau (42.31 and 57.69%) and Pearson's (40 and 60%) correlations.

abstract = {Many natural and technological systems fail to adapt to changing external conditions and move to a different state if the conditions vary too fast. Such 'non-adiabatic' processes are ubiquitous, but little understood. We identify these processes with a new nonlinear phenomenon-an intricate threshold where a forced system fails to adiabatically follow a changing stable state. In systems with multiple time scales, we derive existence conditions that show such thresholds to be generic, but non-obvious, meaning they cannot be captured by traditional stability theory. Rather, the phenomenon can be analysed using concepts from modern singular perturbation theory: folded singularities and canard trajectories, including composite canards. Thus, nonobvious thresholds should explain the failure to adapt to a changing environment in a wide range of multiscale systems including: tipping points in the climate system, regime shifts in ecosystems, excitability in nerve cells, adaptation failure in regulatory genes and adiabatic switching in technology.},

abstract = {The accurate description of the complex genesis and evolution of ocean waves, as well as the associated kinematics and dynamics is indispensable for the design of offshore structures and the assessment of marine operations. In the majority of cases, the water-wave problem is reduced to potential flow theory on a somehow simplified level. However, the nonlinear terms in the surface boundary conditions and the fact that they must be fulfilled on the unknown water surface make the boundary value problem considerably complex. Hereby, the contrary objectives with respect to a very accurate representation of reality and numerical efficiency must be balanced wisely. This paper investigates the influence of characteristic sea state parameters on the accuracy of irregular wave field simulations of different complexity. For this purpose, the high-order spectral method was applied and the underlying Taylor series expansion was truncated at different orders so that numerical simulations of different complexity can be investigated. It is shown that, for specific characteristic sea state parameters, the boundary value problem can be significantly reduced while providing sufficient accuracy.},

abstract = {We consider the effect of slowly varying depth on the values of skewness and kurtosis of weakly nonlinear irregular waves propagating from deeper to shallower water. It is known that the equilibrium value of kurtosis decreases with decreasing depth for waves propagating on constant depth. Waves propagating over a sloping bottom must continually adjust toward a new equilibrium state. We demonstrate that weakly nonlinear waves may need a considerable horizontal propagation distance in order to adjust to a new shallower environment, therefore the kurtosis can be notably different from the equilibrium value for each corresponding depth both on top of and beyond a bottom slope. A change of depth can provoke a wake-like spatially non-uniform distribution of kurtosis on the lee side of the slope. As an application, we anticipate that the probability of freak waves on or near the edge of the continental shelf may exhibit a rather complicated spatial structure for wave fields entering from deep sea. ? 2012 Author(s) CC Attribution 3.0 License.},

abstract = {The growth and reduction of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets over the past million years is dominated by an approximately 100,000-year periodicity and a sawtooth pattern (gradual growth and fast termination). Milankovitch theory proposes that summer insolation at high northern latitudes drives the glacial cycles, and statistical tests have demonstrated that the glacial cycles are indeed linked to eccentricity, obliquity and precession cycles. Yet insolation alone cannot explain the strong 100,000-year cycle, suggesting that internal climatic feedbacks may also be at work. Earlier conceptual models, for example, showed that glacial terminations are associated with the build-up of Northern Hemisphere 'excess ice', but the physical mechanisms underpinning the 100,000-year cycle remain unclear. Here we show, using comprehensive climate and ice-sheet models, that insolation and internal feedbacks between the climate, the ice sheets and the lithosphere-asthenosphere system explain the 100,000-year periodicity. The responses of equilibrium states of ice sheets to summer insolation show hysteresis, with the shape and position of the hysteresis loop playing a key part in determining the periodicities of glacial cycles. The hysteresis loop of the North American ice sheet is such that after inception of the ice sheet, its mass balance remains mostly positive through several precession cycles, whose amplitudes decrease towards an eccentricity minimum. The larger the ice sheet grows and extends towards lower latitudes, the smaller is the insolation required to make the mass balance negative. Therefore, once a large ice sheet is established, a moderate increase in insolation is sufficient to trigger a negative mass balance, leading to an almost complete retreat of the ice sheet within several thousand years. This fast retreat is governed mainly by rapid ablation due to the lowered surface elevation resulting from delayed isostatic rebound, which is the lithosphere-asthenosphere response. Carbon dioxide is involved, but is not determinative, in the evolution of the 100,000-year glacial cycles. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Paleo-proxy records suggest that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) exhibits a threshold for an abrupt change, a so-called tipping point. A classical bifurcation theory, a basis of the tipping dynamics of AMOC implicitly assumes that the tipping point is fixed. However, when a system is subjected to time-varying forcing (e.g., AMOC exposed to ice meltwater) an actual tipping point can be overshot due to delayed tipping, referred to as the slow passage effect. Here, using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity and a low-order model with freshwater forcing, we show that the tipping point of AMOC is largely delayed by the slow passage effect. It causes a large tipping lag of up to 1300 years, and strongly relaxes the abruptness of tipping as well. We further demonstrate that the tipping modulation can actively occur in past, present, and future climates by quantifying the effect during Dansgaard-Oeschger events, meltwater pulse 1A (MWP-1A), and current Greenland ice sheet melting. The suggested slow passage effect may explain the observed lagged AMOC collapse to MWP-1A of about 1000 years and provides implications tipping risk in the future.},

The delayed bifurcation means that the bifurcation does not happen immediately at the bifurcation point as the bifurcation parameter passes through some bifurcation point, but at some other point which is above the bifurcation point by an obvious distance. In a time-delayed system, the evolution of the system depends not only on the present state but also on past states. In this paper, the time-delayed slow-fast system is firstly simplified to a slow-fast system without time delay by means of the center manifold reduction, and then the so-called entry-exit function is defined to characterize the delayed bifurcation on the basis of Neishtadt's theory. It shows that delayed Hopf bifurcation exists in time-delayed slow-fast systems, and the theoretical prediction on the exit-point is in good agreement with the numerical calculation, as illustrated in the two illustrative examples. {\textcopyright} 2010 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Based on the theory of “snapshot/pullback attractors”, we show that important features of the climate change that we are observing can be understood by imagining many replicas of Earth that are not interacting with each other. Their climate systems evolve in parallel, but not in the same way, although they all obey the same physical laws, in harmony with the chaotic-like nature of the climate dynamics. These parallel climate realizations evolving in time can be considered as members of an ensemble. We argue that the contingency of our Earth's climate system is characterized by the multiplicity of parallel climate realizations rather than by the variability that we experience in a time series of our observed past. The natural measure of the snapshot attractor enables one to determine averages and other statistical quantifiers of the climate at any instant of time. In this paper, we review the basic idea for climate changes associated with monotonic drifts, and illustrate the large number of possible applications. Examples are given in a low-dimensional model and in numerical climate models of different complexity. We recall that systems undergoing climate change are not ergodic, hence temporal averages are generically not appropriate for the instantaneous characterization of the climate. In particular, teleconnections, i.e. correlated phenomena of remote geographical locations are properly characterized only by correlation coefficients evaluated with respect to the natural measure of a given time instant, and may also change in time. Physics experiments dealing with turbulent-like phenomena in a changing environment are also worth being interpreted in view of the attractor-based ensemble approach. The possibility of the splitting of the snapshot attractor to two branches, near points where the corresponding time-independent system undergoes bifurcation as a function of the changing parameter, is briefly mentioned. This can lead in certain climate-change scenarios to the coexistence of two distinct sub-ensembles representing dramatically different climatic options. The problem of pollutant spreading during climate change is also discussed in the framework of parallel climate realizations.},

abstract = {Synthetic biology and bioengineering provide the opportunity to create novel embodied cognitive systems (otherwise known as minds) in a very wide variety of chimeric architectures combining evolved and designed material and software. These advances are disrupting familiar concepts in the philosophy of mind, and require new ways of thinking about and comparing truly diverse intelligences, whose composition and origin are not like any of the available natural model species. In this Perspective, I introduce TAME—Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere—a framework for understanding and manipulating cognition in unconventional substrates. TAME formalizes a non-binary (continuous), empirically-based approach to strongly embodied agency. TAME provides a natural way to think about animal sentience as an instance of collective intelligence of cell groups, arising from dynamics that manifest in similar ways in numerous other substrates. When applied to regenerating/developmental systems, TAME suggests a perspective on morphogenesis as an example of basal cognition. The deep symmetry between problem-solving in anatomical, physiological, transcriptional, and 3D (traditional behavioral) spaces drives specific hypotheses by which cognitive capacities can increase during evolution. An important medium exploited by evolution for joining active subunits into greater agents is developmental bioelectricity, implemented by pre-neural use of ion channels and gap junctions to scale up cell-level feedback loops into anatomical homeostasis. This architecture of multi-scale competency of biological systems has important implications for plasticity of bodies and minds, greatly potentiating evolvability. Considering classical and recent data from the perspectives of computational science, evolutionary biology, and basal cognition, reveals a rich research program with many implications for cognitive science, evolutionary biology, regenerative medicine, and artificial intelligence.},

@article{Longuet-Higgins1962,
abstract = {This paper studies the second-order currents and changes in mean surface level which are caused by gravity waves of non-uniform amplitude. The effects are interpreted in terms of the radiation stresses in the waves.The first example is of wave groups propagated in water of uniform mean depth. The problem is solved first by a perturbation analysis. In two special cases the second-order currents are found to be proportional simply to the square of the local wave amplitude: (a) when the lengths of the groups are large compared to the mean depth, and (b) when the groups are all of equal length. Then the surface is found to be depressed under a high group of waves and the mass-transport is relatively negative there. In case (a) the result can be simply related to the radiation stresses, which tend to expel fluid from beneath the higher waves.The second example considered is the propagation of waves of steady amplitude in water of gradually varying depth. Assuming no loss of energy by friction or reflexion, the wave amplitude must vary horizontally, to maintain the flux of energy constant; it is shown that this produces a negative tilt in the mean surface level as the depth diminishes. However, if the wave height is limited by breaking, the tilt is positive. The results are in agreement with some observations by Fairchild.Lastly, the propagation of groups of waves from deep to shallow water is studied. As the mean depth decreases, so the response of the fluid to the radiation stresses tends to increase. The long waves thus generated may be reflected as free waves, and so account for the 'surf beats' observed by Munk and Tucker.Generalle speaking, the changes in mean sea level produced by ocean waves are comparable with those due to horizontal wind stress. It may be necessary to allow for the wave stresses in calculating wind stress coefficients.},

@article{Boettiger2013,
abstract = {The realization that complex systems such as ecological communities can collapse or shift regimes suddenly and without rapid external forcing poses a serious challenge to our understanding and management of the natural world. The potential to identify early warning signals that would allow researchers and managers to predict such events before they happen has therefore been an invaluable discovery that offers a way forward in spite of such seemingly unpredictable behavior. Research into early warning signals has demonstrated that it is possible to define and detect such early warning signals in advance of a transition in certain contexts. Here, we describe the pattern emerging as research continues to explore just how far we can generalize these results. A core of examples emerges that shares three properties: the phenomenon of rapid regime shifts, a pattern of "critical slowing down" that can be used to detect the approaching shift, and a mechanism of bifurcation driving the sudden change. As research has expanded beyond these core examples, it is becoming clear that not all systems that show regime shifts exhibit critical slowing down, or vice versa. Even when systems exhibit critical slowing down, statistical detection is a challenge. We review the literature that explores these edge cases and highlight the need for (a) new early warning behaviors that can be used in cases where rapid shifts do not exhibit critical slowing down; (b) the development of methods to identify which behavior might be an appropriate signal when encountering a novel system, bearing in mind that a positive indication for some systems is a negative indication in others; and (c) statistical methods that can distinguish between signatures of early warning behaviors and noise. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

@article{Fang2018,
abstract = {ABSTRACTIn statistical inverse problems, the objective is a complete statistical description of unknown parameters from noisy observations to quantify uncertainties in unknown parameters. We consider inverse problems with partial-differential-equation (PDE) constraints, which are applicable to many seismic problems. Bayesian inference is one of the most widely used approaches to precisely quantify statistics through a posterior distribution, incorporating uncertainties in observed data, modeling kernel, and prior knowledge of parameters. Typically when formulating the posterior distribution, the PDE constraints are required to be exactly satisfied, resulting in a highly nonlinear forward map and a posterior distribution with many local maxima. These drawbacks make it difficult to find an appropriate approximation for the posterior distribution. Another complicating factor is that traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are known to converge slowly for realistically sized problems. To overcome these drawbacks, we relax the PDE constraints by introducing an auxiliary variable, which allows for Gaussian errors in the PDE and yields a bilinear posterior distribution with weak PDE constraints that is more amenable to uncertainty quantification because of its special structure. We determine that for a particular range of variance choices for the PDE misfit term, the new posterior distribution has fewer modes and can be well-approximated by a Gaussian distribution, which can then be sampled in a straightforward manner. Because it is prohibitively expensive to explicitly construct the dense covariance matrix of the Gaussian approximation for problems with more than 105 unknowns, we have developed a method to implicitly construct it, which enables efficient sampling. We apply this framework to 2D seismic inverse problems with 1800 and 92,455 unknown parameters. The results illustrate that our framework can produce comparable statistical quantities with those produced by conventional MCMC-type methods while requiring far fewer PDE solves, which are the main computational bottlenecks in these problems.},

abstract = {In the study of Boettiger & Hastings [1], we demonstrated that conditioning on observing a purely stochastic transition from one stable basin to another could generate time-series trajectories that could be mistaken for an early warning signal of a critical transition (such as might be due to a fold bifur-cation [2]), when instead the shift is merely due to chance. While the goal was to highlight a potential danger in mining historical records for patterns showing sudden shifts when seeking to test early warning techniques, Drake [3] draws attention to a potentially more interesting consequence of our analysis. Drake argues that the bias observed could be used to forecast purely stochastic transitions-a task previously thought to be impossible [4]. We feel this interpretation is too generous. The pattern Drake points to arises in any large deviation, regardless of whether a system is or is not at elevated risk for a transition. We illustrate this pattern in systems with and without bistability, demonstrating that early warning signals do not exist for purely stochastic transitions. Here, we provide a numerical demonstration that the pattern in question for consideration of an early warning signal appears not only before purely sto-chastic transitions (as seen in [1]) but also during any large deviation. As large deviations can occur even in stochastic systems that have only a single stable point, these patterns cannot be considered indicators of stochastic transitions. We demonstrate this in two scenarios: first using the Allee model of alternative stable states considered in [1], (eqn 2.1-2.2 and fig. 2), and then in a simple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model, which has only a single stable state. Rather than condition on a stochastic transition having occurred (as in [1]), we now condition on having merely observed a sufficiently large deviation (larger deviations will be rarer and show a more pronounced pattern). We pick values such that we obtain a sample of a few hundred large deviation events in a sample of 20 000 replicates. The OU model is defined by a stochastic differential equation in which there is only a single optimum whose strength is proportional to the displacement, dX t ¼ {\`{A}}aX t dt þ sdB t ; where the state X t oscillates around a stable point (at zero in these arbitrary units), driven by Brownian noise dB t of intensity s and restorative force a. The analysis for each model proceeds exactly as in [1]: for each model, we generate 20 000 replicate time series. We condition upon only those experiencing a deviation of size L (X 250 in the Allee model and X 24 in the OU model). For the sequence of observations immediately leading up to the large deviation, we compute the warning signals of variance and autocorrelation over a sliding window of half the length of the time series, and we summarize the increasing or the decreasing trend observed in the variance and autocorrelation using Kendall's t rank correlation coefficient (all following the method for early},

We elaborate the Dysthe approach by investigating the effect of the wave-induced flow on the long-time behaviour of the Benjamin—Feir instability. The occurrence of a wave-induced flow may give rise to a Doppler shift in the frequency of the carrier wave and therefore could explain the observed down-shift in experiment (Lake et al. 1977). However, we present arguments why this is not a proper explanation. Finally, we apply the Dysthe equations to a homogeneous random field of gravity waves and obtain the nonlinear energy-transfer function recently found by Dungey & Hui (1979). {\textcopyright} 1983, Cambridge University Press.

abstract = {Tipping points describe bifurcations where the output of a dynamical system changes disproportionately compared to the change in the parameter. A classification of different mechanism of tipping in dynamical systems has been proposed in literature and a new behaviour has been identified: the so-called rate-induced tipping, R-tipping or rate-induced bifurcation. This work aims at providing a mathematical framework for rate-induced tipping in one dimensional nonautonomous dynamical systems in the presence of bounded noise and to give a necessary condition for such behaviour to occur. It is given an autonomous dynamical system depending on a parameter. The system is generally not undergoing any classical bifurcation under changes in the parameter. We consider the parameter changing in time at a positive rate so that the system is now nonautonomous but asymptotically autonomous. Moreover, consider a bounded time-dependent perturbation so that the system can be regarded as a nonautonomous set-valued (or general) dynamical system. A rate-induced tipping describes a destabilisation of such system due to a rapid change in the parameter, i.e. the existence of a critical rate. A precise definition of rate-induced tipping as a discontinuity in the limiting behaviour of a local pullback attractor is proposed. Under appropriate assumptions, an attractor-repeller collision is shown to be a necessary condition for such tipping to occur.},

We develop the wind model to the same order in wave steepness as the higher order modification of the nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation, also referred to as the Dysthe equation. This results in an asymmetric wind term in the higher order, in addition to the leading order wind forcing term. The derived model is in good agreement with laboratory experiments within the range of the facility's length. We show that the leading order forcing term amplifies all frequencies equally and therefore induces only a broadening of the spectrum, while the asymmetric higher order term in the model enhances the higher frequencies more than the lower ones. Thus, the latter term induces a permanent upshift in the spectral mean. On the other hand, in contrast to the direct effect of wind forcing, wind can indirectly lead to frequency downshifts, due to dissipative effects such aswave breaking, or through the amplification of the intrinsic spectral asymmetry of the Dysthe equation. Furthermore, the definitions of the up- and downshift in terms of peak frequency and mean frequency, which are critical to relate our work to previous results, are highlighted and discussed.},

abstract = {The climate system occasionally experiences an abrupt change. However, it is very difficult to predict this change at present. Fortunately, some generic properties have been revealed before several different types of dynamical system near their own critical thresholds. These properties provide a possible way to give an early warning for an impending abrupt climate change. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the applicability of an early warning indicator of an abrupt change. On the basis of several simple fold models, we have systematically investigated the performance of the kurtosis coefficient as an early warning signal for an upcoming abrupt climate change. The testing results indicate that the kurtosis coefficient is a reliable warning indicator in most of cases whether a critical control parameter or the strength of an external forcing approaches a critical point. However, the strong noise can greatly shorten the effective warning time, and also can result in the reduction of the magnitude of a kurtosis coefficient when a dynamical system approaches its critical threshold. The missing data has almost no effect on the kurtosis coefficient in all of tests, even it is true when the missing data accounts for 20% of the total sample. We also found that the kurtosis coefficient does not work in some cases, which means that the kurtosis coefficient is not a universal early warning signal for an upcoming abrupt change.},

Special attention is paid to the process of self-focusing and wave collapse. Various approaches ranging from rigorous mathematical analysis to formal asymptotic expansions and numerical simulations are presented. The aim is to relate more closely the theoretical understanding of singularity formation to applications in domains such as nonlinear optics, or plasma physics, where this effect provides an efficient mechanism for small scale formation and wave dissipation. An extended and up-to-date bibliography is also included. The book, which fills the gap between mathematical literature and phenomenological modeling, should promote the transfer of information between the various communities concerned with nonlinear waves.},

abstract = {Ecological communities and other complex systems can undergo abrupt and long-lasting reorganization, a regime shift, when deterministic or stochastic factors bring them to the vicinity of a tipping point between alternative states. Such changes can be large and often arise unexpectedly. However, theoretical and experimental analyses have shown that changes in correlation structure, variance, and other standard indicators of biomass, abundance, or other descriptive variables are often observed prior to a state shift, providing early warnings of an anticipated transition. Natural systems manifest unknown mixtures of ecological and environmental processes, hampered by noise and limited observations. As data quality often cannot be improved, it is important to choose the best modeling tools available for the analysis. We investigate three autoregressive models and analyze their theoretical differences and practical performance. We formulate a novel probabilistic method for early warning signal detection and demonstrate performance improvements compared to nonprobabilistic alternatives based on simulation and publicly available experimental time series. The probabilistic formulation provides a novel approach to early warning signal detection and analysis, with enhanced robustness and treatment of uncertainties. In real experimental time series, the new probabilistic method produces results that are consistent with previously reported findings. Robustness to uncertainties is instrumental in the common scenario where mechanistic understanding of the complex system dynamics is not available. The probabilistic approach provides a new family of robust methods for early warning signal detection that can be naturally extended to incorporate variable modeling assumptions and prior knowledge.},

For sufficiently strong variation, corresponding to the so-called strong dispersion management regime, the equation possesses pulse-like solutions which evolve nearly periodically. This phenomenon is explained by constructing ground states for the averaged variational principle and justifying the averaging procedure. Furthermore, it is shown that in certain critical cases (e.g. quintic nonlinearity in one dimension and cubic nonlinearity in two dimensions) the dispersion management technique stabilizes the pulses which otherwise would be unstable. This observation seems to be new and is reminiscent of the well-known Kapitza's effect of stabilizing the inverted pendulum by rapidly moving its pivot. {\textcopyright} 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

A generic phase diagram is presented to explain the generation of dragon-kings. The presence of dragon-kings is documented and assessed in six different examples (distribution of city sizes, distribution of acoustic emissions associated with material failure, distribution of velocity increments in hydrodynamic turbulence, distribution of financial drawdowns, distribution of the energies of epileptic seizures in humans and in model animals, distribution of earthquake energies). Dragon-kings are often associated with a neighborhood of what can be called equivalently a phase transition, a bifurcation, a catastrophe (in the sense of Ren{\'{e}} Thom), or a tipping point. The presence of a phase transition is crucial to learn how to diagnose in advance the symptoms associated with a coming dragon-king. Several examples of predictions using the derived log-periodic power law method are discussed, including material failure predictions and the forecasts of the termination of financial bubbles.},

To address their policy implications, we incorporated five interacting climate tipping points into a stochastic-dynamic integrated assessment model, calibrating their likelihoods and interactions on results from an existing expert elicitation. Here we show that combining realistic assumptions about policymakers' preferences under uncertainty, with the prospect of multiple future interacting climate tipping points, increases the present social cost of carbon in the model nearly eightfold from US$15 per tCO2 to US$116 per tCO2. Furthermore, passing some tipping points increases the likelihood of other tipping points occurring to such an extent that it abruptly increases the social cost of carbon. The corresponding optimal policy involves an immediate, massive effort to control CO2 emissions, which are stopped by mid-century, leading to climate stabilization at <1.5{\thinspace}{\textdegree}C above pre-industrial levels.},

Superimposed on these long glacial cycles comes an intricate pattern of millennial and sub-millennial variability, including Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich events. There are numerous theories about these oscillations. Here, we review a number of them in order to draw a parallel between climatic concepts and dynamical system concepts, including, in particular, the relaxation oscillator, excitability, slow-fast dynamics and homoclinic orbits. Namely, almost all theories of ice ages reviewed here feature a phenomenon of synchronization between internal climate dynamics and astronomical forcing. However, these theories differ in their bifurcation structure and this has an effect on the way the ice age phenomenon could grow 3 Ma ago. All theories on rapid events reviewed here rely on the concept of a limit cycle excited by changes in the surface freshwater balance of the ocean. The article also reviews basic effects of stochastic fluctuations on these models, including the phenomenon of phase dispersion, shortening of the limit cycle and stochastic resonance. It concludes with a more personal statement about the potential for inference with simple stochastic dynamical systems in palaeoclimate science. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society.},

Because critical transitions can occur unexpectedly and are difficult to manage, there is a need for methods that can be used to identify when a critical transition is approaching. Recent theory shows that we can identify the proximity of a system to a critical transition using a variety of so-called 'early warning signals', and successful empirical examples suggest a potential for practical applicability. However, while the range of proposed methods for predicting critical transitions is rapidly expanding, opinions on their practical use differ widely, and there is no comparative study that tests the limitations of the different methods to identify approaching critical transitions using time-series data. Here, we summarize a range of currently available early warning methods and apply them to two simulated time series that are typical of systems undergoing a critical transition. In addition to a methodological guide, our work offers a practical toolbox that may be used in a wide range of fields to help detect early warning signals of critical transitions in time series data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Dakos et al.},

As shown here, these hydrodynamic instantons are complex spatiotemporal wave field configurations which can be defined using the mathematical framework of large deviation theory and calculated via tailored numerical methods.

We take a stylized ecosystem model with an unknown tipping point and derive a standard EWS. We then demonstrate 15 the necessary steps to utilize the EWS and show why it improves ecosystem management. We discuss critical dimensions of EWS design and highlight that EWS may occasionally increase the risk of collapse, even in managed systems. Better understanding how, when, and why EWS may improve management is therefore an essential complement to the emerging knowledge on detecting EWS. (119 words) 20 JEL Classification: C61, D83, Q54},

abstract = {Palaeorecords suggest that the climate system has tipping points, where small changes in forcing cause substantial and irreversible alteration to Earth system components called tipping elements. As atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise as a result of fossil fuel burning, human activity could also trigger tipping, and the impacts would be difficult to adapt to. Previous studies report low global warming thresholds above pre-industrial conditions for key tipping elements such as ice-sheet melt. If so, high contemporary rates of warming imply that exceeding these thresholds is almost inevitable, which is widely assumed to mean that we are now committed to suffering these tipping events. Here we show that this assumption may be flawed, especially for slow-onset tipping elements (such as the collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) in our rapidly changing climate. Recently developed theory indicates that a threshold may be temporarily exceeded without prompting a change of system state, if the overshoot time is short compared to the effective timescale of the tipping element. To demonstrate this, we consider transparently simple models of tipping elements with prescribed thresholds, driven by global warming trajectories that peak before returning to stabilize at a global warming level of 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level. These results highlight the importance of accounting for timescales when assessing risks associated with overshooting tipping point thresholds.},

abstract = {Many systems in various scientific fields like medicine, ecology, economics or climate science exhibit so-called critical transitions, through which a system abruptly changes from one state to a different state. Typical examples are epileptic seizures, changes in the climate system or catastrophic shifts in ecosystems. In order to predict imminent critical transitions, a mathematical apparatus called early warning signals has been developed and this method is used successfully in many scientific areas. However, not all critical transitions can be detected by this approach (false negative) and the appearance of early warning signals does not necessarily proof that a critical transition is imminent (false positive). Furthermore, there are whole classes of systems that always show early warning signals, even though they do not feature critical transitions. In this study we identify such classes in order to provide a safeguard against a misinterpretation of the results of an early warning signal analysis of such systems. Furthermore, we discuss strategies to avoid such systematic false positives and test our theoretical insights by applying them to real world data.},

abstract = {Since the 1990s, the modulational instability has commonly been used to explain the occurrence of rogue waves that appear from nowhere in the open ocean. However, the importance of this instability in the context of ocean waves is not well established. This mechanism has been successfully studied in laboratory experiments and in mathematical studies, but there is no consensus on what actually takes place in the ocean. In this work, we question the oceanic relevance of this paradigm. In particular, we analyze several sets of field data in various European locations with various tools and find that the main generation mechanism for rogue waves is the constructive interference of elementary waves enhanced by second-order bound nonlinearities and not the modulational instability. This implies that rogue waves are likely to be rare occurrences of weakly nonlinear random seas.},

abstract = {Early warning signals (EWS) are statistical indicators that a rapid regime shift may be forthcoming. Their development has given ecologists hope of predicting rapid regime shifts before they occur. Accurate predictions, however, rely on the signals being appropriate to the system in question. Most of the EWS commonly applied in ecology have been studied in the context of one specific type of regime shift (the type brought on by a saddle-node bifurcation, at which one stable equilibrium point collides with an unstable equilibrium and disappears) under one particular perturbation scheme (temporally uncorrelated noise that perturbs the net population growth rate in a density independent way). Whether and when these EWS can be applied to other ecological situations remains relatively unknown, and certainly underappreciated. We study a range of models with different types of dynamical transitions (including rapid regime shifts) and several perturbation schemes (density-dependent uncorrelated or temporally-correlated noise) and test the ability of EWS to warn of an approaching transition. We also test the sensitivity of our results to the amount of available pre-transition data and various decisions that must be made in the analysis (i.e. the rolling window size and smoothing bandwidth used to compute the EWS). We find that EWS generally work well to signal an impending saddle-node bifurcation, regardless of the autocorrelation or intensity of the noise. However, EWS do not reliably appear as expected for other types of transition. EWS were often very sensitive to the length of the pre-transition time series analyzed, and usually less sensitive to other decisions. We conclude that the EWS perform well for saddle-node bifurcation in a range of noise environments, but different methods should be used to predict other types of regime shifts. As a consequence, knowledge of the mechanism behind a possible regime shift is needed before EWS can be used to predict it.},

This “viscous Dysthe” system models the evolution of a weakly viscous, nearly monochromatic wave train on deep water. It includes only one free parameter, which can be determined empirically. It contains a term that provides a mechanism for frequency downshifting in the absence of wind and wave breaking. The system does not preserve the spectral mean. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the spectral mean typically decreases and that the spectral peak decreases for certain initial conditions. The linear stability analysis of the plane-wave solutions of the viscous Dysthe system demonstrates that waves with frequencies closer to zero decay more slowly than waves with frequencies further from zero. Comparisons between experimental data and numerical simulations of the nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger, dissipative nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger, Dysthe, and viscous Dysthe systems establish that the viscous Dysthe system accurately models data from experiments in which frequency downshifting was observed and experiments in which frequency downshift was not observed.},

Such events are obtained in our periodic-domain HOS model by using different kinds of configurations: either i) we impose an initial 3-D directional spectrum with the phases adjusted so as to form a focused forced event after a while, or ii) we let 2-D and 3-D wavefields defined by a directional wave spectrum evolve up to the natural appearance of freak waves. Finally, we investigate the influence of directionality on extreme wave events with an original study of the 3-D shape of the detected freak waves.},

Such ruptures involve interactions between structures at many different scales. Applications and the potential for prediction are discussed in relation to the rupture of composite materials, great earthquakes, turbulence, and abrupt changes of weather regimes, financial crashes, and human parturition (birth). Future improvements will involve combining ideas and tools from statistical physics and artificial/computational intelligence, to identify and classify possible universal structures that occur at different scales, and to develop application-specific methodologies to use these structures for prediction of the "crises" known to arise in each application of interest. We live on a planet and in a society with intermittent dynamics rather than a state of equilibrium, and so there is a growing and urgent need to sensitize students and citizens to the importance and impacts of ruptures in their multiple forms.},

In this region, waves of surprisingly large size, alternatively called freak, rogue, or giant waves are produced. We show how this mechanism produces freak waves at random locations when ocean swell traverses an area of random current. When the current has a constant (possibly zero) mean with small random fluctuations, we show that the probability distribution for the formation of a freak wave is universal, that is, it does not depend on the statistics of the current, but only on a single distance scale parameter, provided that this parameter is finite and non-xero. Our numerical simulations show excellent agreement with the theory, even for current standard deviation as large as 1.0 m s-1. Since many of these results are derived for arbitrary dispersion relations with certain general properties, they include as a special case previously published work on caustics in geometrical optics.},

abstract = {It is well known that periodic forcing of a nonlinear system, even of a 2D autonomous system, can produce chaotic responses with sensitive dependence on initial conditions if the forcing induces sufficient stretching and folding of the phase space. Quasiperiodic forcing can similarly produce chaotic responses, where the transition to chaos on changing a parameter can bring the system into regions of strange non-chaotic behaviour. Although it is generally acknowledged that the timings of Pleistocene ice ages are at least partly due to Milankovitch forcing (which may be approximated as quasiperiodic, with energy concentrated near a small number of frequencies), the precise details of what can be inferred about the timings of glaciations and deglaciations from the forcing are still unclear. In this article, we perform a quantitative comparison of the response of several low-order nonlinear conceptual models for these ice ages to various types of quasiperiodic forcing. By computing largest Lyapunov exponents and mean periods, we demonstrate that many models can have a chaotic response to quasiperiodic forcing for a range of forcing amplitudes, even though some of the simplest conceptual models do not. These results suggest that pacing of ice ages to forcing may have only limited determinism.},

Thus, it is crucial to devise effective and efficient estimation methods for heavy tails of degree distributions in large-scale networks only using local information of a small fraction of sampled nodes. Here we propose a tail-scope method based on local observational bias of the friendship paradox. We show that the tail-scope method outperforms the uniform node sampling for estimating heavy tails of degree distributions, while the opposite tendency is observed in the range of small degrees. In order to take advantages of both sampling methods, we devise the hybrid method that successfully recovers the whole range of degree distributions. Our tail-scope method shows how structural heterogeneities of large-scale complex networks can be used to effectively reveal the network structure only with limited local information.},

abstract = {In the vicinity of a tipping point, critical transitions occur when small changes in an input condition cause sudden, large, and often irreversible changes in the state of a system. Many natural systems ranging from ecosystems to molecular biosystems are known to exhibit critical transitions in their response to stochastic perturbations. In diseases, an early prediction of upcoming critical transitions from a healthy to a disease state by using early-warning signals is of prime interest due to potential application in forecasting disease onset. Here, we analyze cell-fate transitions between different phenotypes (epithelial, hybridepithelial/ mesenchymal [E/M], and mesenchymal states) that are implicated in cancer metastasis and chemoresistance. These transitions are mediated by a mutually inhibitory feedback loop- microRNA-200/ZEB-driven by the levels of transcription factor SNAIL. We find that the proximity to tipping points enabling these transitions among different phenotypes can be captured by critical slowing down-based early-warning signals, calculated from the trajectory of ZEB messenger RNA level. Further, the basin stability analysis reveals the unexpectedly large basin of attraction for a hybrid-E/M phenotype. Finally, we identified mechanisms that can potentially elude the transition to a hybrid- E/M phenotype. Overall, our results unravel the early-warning signals that can be used to anticipate upcoming epithelial-hybridmesenchymal transitions. With the emerging evidence about the hybrid-E/M phenotype being a key driver of metastasis, drug resistance, and tumor relapse, our results suggest ways to potentially evade these transitions, reducing the fitness of cancer cells and restricting tumor aggressiveness.},

The results show that a well-defined freak wave may occur in the developed wind-wave condition: S(f)∝f-4, with single-peak directional spectra. The crest and trough amplitude distributions of the observed sea waves including freak waves are different from the Rayleigh distribution, although the wave height distribution tends to agree with the Rayleigh distribution.

In particular, it is found that either management scheme, if applied along the longitudinal coordinate, making the underlying nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation (NLSE) self-defocusing in the course of disappearance of the PS, indeed stabilizes the global solution with respect to the modulational instability of the background. In the process, additional excitations are generated, namely, dispersive shock waves and, in some cases, also a pair of slowly separating dark solitons. Further, the nonlinearity-management format, which makes the NLSE defocusing outside of a finite domain in the transverse direction, enables the stabilization of the KMBs, in the form of confined oscillating states. On the other hand, a nonlinearity-management format applied periodically along the propagation direction, creates expanding patterns featuring multiplication of KMBs through their cascading fission.},

This paper presents a technique for the extraction of backbone curves of lightly damped nonlinear systems that is well suited for the experimental investigation of structures exhibiting nonlinear behaviour. The approach is based on estimations of the instantaneous frequency and the envelope amplitude of a decaying response following a tuned steady-state oscillation of the system. Results obtained from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed procedure is capable of achieving an accurate estimation of the backbone curves and damping ratios of the system provided that the premise of damping having low impact on its oscillation frequency is met.},

We show that, in contrast to the case without modulation, the Kuznetsov–Ma soliton develops multiple compression points whose number, shape and position are controlled both by the intensity of the modulation and by its frequency. In addition, when this modulation frequency is a rational multiple of the natural frequency of the Kuznetsov–Ma soliton, a scenario similar to a nonlinear resonance is obtained: in this case the spatial oscillations of the Kuznetsov-��Ma soliton's intensity are periodic. When the ratio of the two frequencies is irrational, the soliton's intensity is a quasiperiodic function. A striking and important result of our analysis is the possibility to suppress any component of the output spectrum of the Kuznetsov–Ma soliton by a judicious choice of the amplitude and frequency of the modulation.},

abstract = {Early warning signals have been proposed to forecast the possibility of a critical transition, such as the eutrophication of a lake, the collapse of a coral reef or the end of a glacial period. Because such transitions often unfold on temporal and spatial scales that can be difficult to approach by experimental manipulation, research has often relied on historical observations as a source of natural experiments. Here, we examine a critical difference between selecting systems for study based on the fact that we have observed a critical transition and those systems for which we wish to forecast the approach of a transition. This difference arises by conditionally selecting systems known to experience a transition of some sort and failing to account for the bias this introduces-a statistical error often known as the prosecutor's fallacy. By analysing simulated systems that have experienced transitions purely by chance, we reveal an elevated rate of false-positives in common warning signal statistics. We further demonstrate a model-based approach that is less subject to this bias than those more commonly used summary statistics. We note that experimental studies with replicates avoid this pitfall entirely. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society 2012.},

The existence is predicted of eigensolutions propagating unchanged along the fiber, which may be either spatially stable or spatially unstable, depending on the total power and the propagation-constant mismatch. The presence of spatially unstable eigensolutions dramatically affects the power exchange among the three waves.

abstract = {There is currently much interest in examining climatic tipping points, to see if it is feasible to predict them in advance. Using techniques from bifurcation theory, recent work looks for a slowing down of the intrinsic transient responses, which is predicted to occur before an instability is encountered. This is done, for example, by determining the short-term autocorrelation coefficient ARC(1) in a sliding window of the time-series: this stability coefficient should increase to unity at tipping. Such studies have been made both on climatic computer models and on real paleoclimate data preceding ancient tipping events. The latter employ reconstituted time-series provided by ice cores, sediments, etc., and seek to establish whether the actual tipping could have been accurately predicted in advance. One such example is the end of the Younger Dryas event, about 11 500 years ago, when the Arctic warmed by 7°C in 50 yrs. A second gives an excellent prediction for the end of "greenhouse" Earth about 34 million years ago when the climate tipped from a tropical state into an icehouse state, using data from tropical Pacific sediment cores. This prediction science is very young, but some encouraging results are already being obtained. Future analyses will clearly need to embrace both real data from improved monitoring instruments, and simulation data generated from increasingly sophisticated predictive models. {\textcopyright} 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract = {Forecasting sudden changes in complex systems is a critical but challenging task, with previously developed methods varying widely in their reliability. Here we develop a novel detection method, using simple theoretical models to train a deep neural network to detect critical transitions - the Early Warning Signal Network (EWSNet). We then demonstrate that this network, trained on simulated data, can reliably predict observed real-world transitions in systems ranging from rapid climatic change to the collapse of ecological populations. Importantly, our model appears to capture latent properties in time series missed by previous warning signals approaches, allowing us to not only detect if a transition is approaching, but critically whether the collapse will be catastrophic or non-catastrophic. These novel properties mean EWSNet has the potential to serve as an indicator of transitions across a broad spectrum of complex systems, without requiring information on the structure of the system being monitored. Our work highlights the practicality of deep learning for addressing further questions pertaining to ecosystem collapse and has much broader management implications.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The Benjamin-Feir instability is a modulational instability in which a uniform train of oscillatory waves of moderate amplitude loses energy to a small perturbation of other waves with nearly the same frequency and direction. The concept is well established in water waves, in plasmas and in optics. In each of these applications, the nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation is also well established as an approximate model based on the same assumptions as required for the derivation of the Benjamin-Feir theory: a narrow-banded spectrum of waves of moderate amplitude, propagating primarily in one direction in a dispersive medium with little or no dissipation. In this paper, we show that for waves with narrow bandwidth and moderate amplitude, any amount of dissipation (of a certain type) stabilizes the instability. We arrive at this stability result first by proving it rigorously for a damped version of the nonlinear Schr̈dinger equation, and then by confirming our theoretical predictions with laboratory experiments on waves of moderate amplitude in deep water. The Benjamin-Feir instability is often cited as the first step in a nonlinear process that spreads energy from an initially narrow bandwidth to a broader bandwidth. In this process, sidebands grow exponentially until nonlinear interactions eventually bound their growth. In the presence of damping, this process might still occur, but our work identifies another possibility: damping can stop the growth of perturbations before nonlinear interactions become important. In this case, if the perturbations are small enough initially, then they never grow large enough for nonlinear interactions to become important. {\textcopyright} 2005 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Purpose: The specific mechanisms and biomarkersunderlying the progression of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remain unclear. The current study aims to explore novel gene biomarkers associated with CAD progression by analyzing the transcriptomic sequencing data of peripheral blood monocytes in different stages of CAD. Material and Methods: A total of 24 age- and sex- matched patients at different CAD stages who received coronary angiography were enrolled, which included 8 patients with normal coronary angiography, 8 patients with angiographic intermediate lesion, and 8 patients with AMI. The RNA from peripheral blood monocytes was extracted and transcriptome sequenced to analyze the gene expression and the differentially expressed genes (DEG). A Gene Oncology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed to analyze the biological function of genes. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to classify genes into several gene modules with similar expression profiles, and correlation analysis was carried out to explore the association of each gene module with a clinical trait. The dynamic network biomarker (DNB) algorithm was used to calculate the key genes that promote disease progression. Finally, the overlapping genes between different analytic methods were explored. Results: WGCNA analysis identified a total of nine gene modules, of which two modules have the highest positive association with CAD stages. GO enrichment analysis indicated that the biological function of genes in these two gene modules was closely related to inflammatory response, which included T-cell activation, cell response to inflammatory stimuli, lymphocyte activation, cytokine production, and the apoptotic signaling pathway. DNB analysis identified a total of 103 genes that may play key roles in the progression of atherosclerosis plaque. The overlapping genes between DEG/WGCAN and DNB analysis identified the following 13 genes that may play key roles in the progression of atherosclerosis disease: SGPP2, DAZAP2, INSIG1, CD82, OLR1, ARL6IP1, LIMS1, CCL5, CDK7, HBP1, PLAU, SELENOS, and DNAJB6. Conclusions: The current study identified a total of 13 genes that may play key roles in the progression of atherosclerotic plaque and provides new insights for early warning biomarkers and underlying mechanisms underlying the progression of CAD.},

abstract = {The autoresonance in nonlinear three-wave interactions is discussed. The phenomenon is characteristic of inhomogeneous (or time-dependent) media in the presence of nonlinear wave-vector (frequency) shifts and leads to a persistent and efficient redistribution of the wave action fluxes (action densities) via a continuing spatial (temporal) self-adjustment of the nonlinear resonance relation. Conditions for the autoresonance are found and the phenomenon is illustrated by numerical examples. PACS numbers: 03.40.Kf, 52.35.Mw Nonlinear three-wave resonant interactions (3WRI) are of great importance, since they describe the lowest order (in terms of wave amplitudes) nonlinear effects in the evolution of perturbations in many physical systems [1]. Historically, the theory of the 3WRI proceeded from homogeneous and time-independent equilibria, through the inclusion of a one-dimensional inhomogeneity [2,3] and nonlinear frequency shifts [4], and, finally, to the three-dimensional evolution of the interaction in uniform [1] and one-dimensional [5] media. A 3WRI process requires satisfaction of the resonance relations cu$\sim$ =to2+to3 and k$\sim$ =k2+k3 for the frequencies and wave vectors of the interacting waves. Therefore, any factor afl'ecting these relations makes a large influence on the 3WRI. Inhomogeneity, for example, limits the efl'ective spatial three-wave interaction range as the wave vectors detune from the exact resonance relation. A classical application of this phenomenon is the stabilization of the explosive instability (one of the important cases of the 3WRI) by an inhomogeneity [2]. Nonlinear frequency shifts are also known to stabilize the explosive instability [4] because of the dependence of the resonance relations on the amplitudes of the waves. Our goal is to consider the combined effect of inhomogeneity (or time dependence) of the medium and nonlinearity of the wave dispersions on the 3WRI. We shall see that the width of the resonant interaction region in an inhomogeneous medium can be significantly broadened or even become infinite, with the addition of the nonlinearity, provided the system enters the autaresonant interaction regime (hereafter referred to as the 3WARI). The autoreso-nance phenomenon was studied previously in the context of accelerators [6], atomic physics [7], nonlinear dynamics [81, and pairwise mode conversion [9], and this Letter presents an extension of the idea to the 3WRI. The starting point of our theory is the system of 3WRI equations in a one-dimensional, weakly inhomogeneous and slowly time-dependent medium, L)(D()A)+i(D$\sim$+BD$\sim$)A$\sim$ = cA2Aex3(ip%'), (2) where s; and p; are the signs of the group velocities v; =-(t)D;/1)k;)/(|)D;/&to;) and action densities W; =-(tJD;/rJto;) l A; l of the three waves, respectively, A =I'D;/ak; I'"A;, '= l(aD, /ek,)(aD,Irk,)(aD,/ t)k 3) l ', and the nonlinear wave vector shifts are defined via 6k; =p;6D; l (t)D, /t)k,) l-'. Now, for simplicity, let us further restrict the analysis to the situation when s; & 0 (the three waves propagate in the positive x direction) and introduce the absolute values B; and complex phases p; of the wave amplitudes.

In the case c=bD; =0, Eqs.

For a weak non-linearity, we can still define to; and k; by the ray equations of the linear problem, i.e. , set D; =0 in (1) for nonzero c and 6D;.

abstract = {It is well known that the spectral peak of wind-induced gravity waves on the sea surface tends to shift to lower frequencies as the fetch increases. In past theories the nonlinear dynamics subsequent to Benjamin–Feir instability has been found to initiate the downshift in narrow-banded waves in the absence of wind. However, these weakly nonlinear theories all predict the downshift to be only the first phase of an almost cyclic process. Limited by the length of a wave tank, existing experiments are usually made with relatively steep waves which often break. Although there is a theory on how breaking adds dissipation to stop the reversal of the initial trend of downshift, the details of breaking must be crudely characterized by semi-empirical hypotheses.Since the direct role of wind itself must be relevant to the entire development of wind-wave spectrum, we examine here the effect of wind on the nonlinear evolution of unstable sidebands in narrow-banded waves. We assume that the waves do not break and consider the case where the nonlinear effects that initiate the downshift, energy input by wind and damping by internal dissipation all occur on the same timescale. This means that not only must the waves be mild but the wind stress intensity must also lie within a certain narrow range. With these limitations we couple the air flow above the waves with Dysthe's extension of the cubic Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation, and examine the initial as well as the long-time evolution of a mechanically generated wavetrain. For a variety of wind intensities, downshift is indeed found to be enhanced and rendered long lasting.},

abstract = {As the recent COVID-19 pandemic has shown us, there is a critical need to develop new approaches to monitoring the outbreak and spread of infectious disease. Improvements in monitoring will enable a timely implementation of control measures, including vaccine and quarantine, to stem the spread of disease. One such approach involves the use of early warning signals to detect when critical transitions are about to occur. Although the early detection of a stochastic transition is difficult to predict using the generic indicators of early warning signals theory, the changes detected by the indicators do tell us that some type of transition is taking place. This observation will serve as the foundation of the method described in the article. We consider a susceptible–infectious–susceptible epidemic model with reproduction number R> 1 so that the deterministic endemic equilibrium is stable. Stochastically, realizations will fluctuate around this equilibrium for a very long time until, as a rare event, the noise will induce a transition from the endemic state to the extinct state. In this article, we describe how metric-based indicators from early warning signals theory can be used to monitor the state of the system. By measuring the autocorrelation, return rate, skewness, and variance of the time series, it is possible to determine when the system is in a weakened state. By applying a control that emulates vaccine/quarantine when the system is in this weakened state, we can cause the disease to go extinct earlier than it otherwise would without control. We also demonstrate that applying a control at the wrong time (when the system is in a non-weakened, highly resilient state) can lead to a longer extinction time than if no control had been applied. This feature underlines the importance of determining the system's state of resilience before attempting to affect its behavior through control measures.},

abstract = {We develop a definition of rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) in discrete-time dynamical systems (maps) and prove results giving conditions under which R-tipping will or will not happen. Specifically, we study (possibly noninvertible) maps with a time-varying parameter subject to a parameter shift. We show that each stable path has a unique associated solution (a local pullback attractor) which stays near the path for all negative time. When the parameter changes slowly, this local pullback attractor stays near the path for all time, but if the parameter changes quickly, the local pullback attractor may move away from the path in positive time; this is the phenomenon of R-tipping. We demonstrate that forward basin stability is an insufficient condition to prevent R-tipping in maps of any dimension but that forward inflowing stability is sufficient. Furthermore, we show that R-tipping will happen when there is a certain kind of forward basin instability, and we prove precisely what happens to the local pullback attractor as the rate of the parameter change approaches infinity. We then highlight the differences between discrete- and continuous-time systems by showing that when a map is obtained by discretizing a flow, the pullback attractors for the map and flow can have dramatically different behavior; there may be R-tipping in one system but not in the other. We finish by applying our results to demonstrate R-tipping in the 2-dimensional Ikeda map.},

abstract = {Land use change is a principal force and inherent element of global environmental change, threatening biodiversity, natural ecosystems, and their services. However, our ability to anticipate future land use change is severely limited by a lack of understanding of how major socio-economic disturbances (e.g., wars, revolutions, policy changes, and economic crises) affect land use. Here we explored to what extent socio-economic disturbances can shift land use systems onto a different trajectory, and whether this can result in less intensive land use. Our results show that the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused a major reorganization in land use systems. The effects of this socio-economic disturbance were at least as drastic as those of the nuclear disaster in the Chernobyl region in 1986. While the magnitudes of land abandonment were similar in Ukraine and Belarus in the case of the nuclear disaster (28% and 36% of previously farmed land, respectively), the rates of land abandonment after the collapse of the Soviet Union in Ukraine were twice as high as those in Belarus. This highlights that national policies and institutions play an important role in mediating effects of socio-economic disturbances. The socio-economic disturbance that we studied caused major hardship for local populations, yet also presents opportunities for conservation, as natural ecosystems are recovering on large areas of former farmland. Our results illustrate the potential of socio-economic disturbances to revert land use intensification and the important role institutions and policies play in determining land use systems' resilience against such socio-economic disturbances. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {We discuss the coupling processes between surface gravity waves and adjacent winds and currents in turbulent boundary layers. These processes mediate exchanges of momentum, heat, and gases between the atmosphere and ocean and thus are of global significance for climate. Surface waves grow primarily by pressure-form stress from airflow over the waveforms, and they dissipate in the open sea by wave breaking that injects and stirs momentum, energy, and bubbles into the ocean. Wave motions pump wind eddies that control fluxes across the lower atmosphere. Flow separation occurs behind steep wave crests, and at high winds the crests flatten into spume, which diminishes the drag coefficient. In the ocean the Lagrangian-mean wave velocity, Stokes drift, induces a vortex force and material transport. These generate Langmuir circulations penetrating throughout the boundary layer and enhancing entrainment at the stratified interior interface in combination with other turbulent eddies and inertial-shear instability.

In addition, we aimed to construct a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for skewness and kurtosis values in various samples sizes. Materials and Methods: In our simulation study, 10,000 samples with replacement were taken from the standard normal population. Various sample sizes were evaluated. Data which were obtained from an animal study were used for comparison of t-test's and Wilcoxon sign test's power in small sample. Results: According to our results, sampling distribution of skewness coefficients has normal distribution; however, kurtosis coefficients have positively skewed distribution. A bootstrap confidence interval for these coefficients by using these sampling distribution can be used for normality test. Moreover, it was shown that test statistic for the mean has t-distribution in all studied sample sizes. Conclusion: We can say that distribution shape of the variable plays a more important role than sample size in selection of appropriate test statistic. {\textcopyright} Medical Journal of Trakya University.

abstract = {Regular vegetation patterns have been predicted to indicate a system slowing down and possibly desertification of drylands. However, these predictions have not yet been observed in dryland vegetation due to the inherent logistic difficulty to gather longer-term in situ data. Here, we evaluate the theoretical prediction that regular vegetation patterns are associated with empirically derived temporal indicators (autocorrelation, variance, responsiveness) of critical slowing down in a dryland ecosystem in Sudan using different remote sensing products. We use recently developed methods using remote-sensing EVI time-series in combination with classified regular vegetation patterns along a rainfall gradient in Sudan to test the predicted slowing down. We tested our empirical findings against theoretical predictions from a stochastic version of a spatial explicit model that has been used to describe vegetation dynamics in drylands under aridity stress. Overall, three temporal indicators (responsiveness, temporal autocorrelation, variance) show slowing down as vegetation patterns change from gaps to labyrinths to spots towards more arid conditions, confirming predictions. However, this transition exhibits non-linearities, specifically when patterns change configuration. Model simulations reveal that the transition between patterns temporarily slows down the system affecting the temporal indicators. These transient states when vegetation patterns reorganize thus affect the systems resilience indicators in a non-linear way. Our findings suggest that spatial self-organization of dryland vegetation is associated with critical slowing down, but this transition towards reduced resilience happens in a non-linear way. Future work should aim to better understand transient dynamics in regular vegetation patterns in dryland ecosystems, because long transients make regular vegetation patterns of limited use for management in anticipating critical transitions.},

Although both types of sequences are highly heterogeneous, they are quantitatively distinguishable by new fluctuation analysis method that differentiates local patchiness from long-range correlations.

Universality of these early warning signals has been proposed, but no formal proof has been provided. Here, we show that in relatively simple ecological models the most commonly used early warning signals for a catastrophic collapse can be silent. We underpin the mathematical reason for this phenomenon, which involves the direction of the eigenvectors of the system. Our results demonstrate that claims on the universality of early warning signals are not correct, and that catastrophic collapses can occur without prior warning. In order to correctly predict a collapse and determine whether early warning signals precede the collapse, detailed knowledge of the mathematical structure of the approaching bifurcation is necessary. Unfortunately, such knowledge is often only obtained after the collapse has already occurred. {\textcopyright} 2013 Boerlijst et al.},

Here, we develop a model-free method to detect early-warning signals of such critical transitions, even with only a small number of samples. Specifically, we theoretically derive an index based on a dynamical network biomarker (DNB) that serves as a general early-warning signal indicating an imminent bifurcation or sudden deterioration before the critical transition occurs. Based on theoretical analyses, we show that predicting a sudden transition from small samples is achievable provided that there are a large number of measurements for each sample, e.g., high-throughput data. We employ microarray data of three diseases to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The relevance of DNBs with the diseases was also validated by related experimental data and functional analysis.},

abstract = {We consider the effect on tipping from an additive periodic forcing in a canonical model with a saddle node bifurcation and a slowly varying bifurcation parameter. Here tipping refers to the dramatic change in dynamical behavior characterized by a rapid transition away from a previously attracting state. In the absence of the periodic forcing, it is well known that a slowly varying bifurcation parameter produces a delay in this transition, beyond the bifurcation point for the static case. Using a multiple scales analysis, we consider the effect of amplitude and frequency of the periodic forcing relative to the drifting rate of the slowly varying bifurcation parameter. We show that a high frequency oscillation drives an earlier tipping when the bifurcation parameter varies more slowly, with the advance of the tipping point proportional to the square of the ratio of amplitude to frequency. In the low frequency case the position of the tipping point is affected by the frequency, amplitude, and phase of the oscillation. The results are based on an analysis of the local concavity of the trajectory, used for low frequencies both of the same order as the drifting rate of the bifurcation parameter and for low frequencies larger than the drifting rate. The tipping point location is advanced with increased amplitude of the periodic forcing, with critical amplitudes where there are jumps in the location, yielding significant advances in the tipping point. We demonstrate the analysis for two applications with saddle node-type bifurcations.},

Repeated cycles of such conversion and back-conversion constitute a manifestation of the universal nonlinear phenomenon known as Fermi-Pasta-Ulam recurrence. However, it remains a major challenge to observe the coexistence of different types of recurrences owing to the spontaneous symmetry-breaking nature of such a phenomenon. Here, we implement a novel non-destructive technique that allows the evolution in amplitude and phase of frequency modes to be reconstructed via post-processing of the fibre backscattered light. We clearly observe how control of the input modulation seed results in different recursive behaviours emerging from the phase-space structure dictated by the spontaneously broken symmetry. The proposed technique is an important tool to characterize other mixing processes and new regimes of rogue-wave formation and wave turbulence in fibre optics.},

abstract = {During the decline to extinction, animal populations may present dynamical phenomena not exhibited by robust populations1,2. Some of these phenomena, such as the scaling of demographic variance, are related to small size3-6 whereas others result from density-dependent nonlinearities7. Although understanding the causes of population extinction has been a central problem in theoretical biology for decades8, the ability to anticipate extinction has remained elusive9. Here we argue that the causes of a population's decline are central to the predictability of its extinction. Specifically, environmental degradation may cause a tipping point in population dynamics, corresponding to a bifurcation in the underlying population growth equations, beyond which decline to extinction is almost certain. In such cases, imminent extinction will be signalled by critical slowing down (CSD). We conducted an experiment with replicate laboratory populations of Daphnia magna to test this hypothesis. We show that populations crossing a transcritical bifurcation, experimentally induced by the controlled decline in environmental conditions, show statistical signatures of CSD after the onset of environmental deterioration and before the critical transition. Populations in constant environments did not have these patterns. Four statistical indicators all showed evidence of the approaching bifurcation as early as 110 days (∼8 generations) before the transition occurred. Two composite indices improved predictability, and comparative analysis showed that early warning signals based solely on observations in deteriorating environments without reference populations for standardization were hampered by the presence of transient dynamics before the onset of deterioration, pointing to the importance of reliable baseline data before environmental deterioration begins. The universality of bifurcations in models of population dynamics suggests that this phenomenon should be general10-12. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Identifying approaching bifurcations and regime transitions from observations is an important challenge in time series analysis with practical applications in many fields of science. Well-known indicators are the increase in spatial and temporal correlations. However, the performance of these indicators depends on the system under study and on the type of approaching bifurcation, and no indicator provides a reliable warning for any system and bifurcation. Here we propose an indicator that simultaneously takes into account information about spatial and temporal correlations. By performing a bivariate correlation analysis of signals recorded in pairs of adjacent spatial points, and analyzing the distribution of lag times that maximize the cross-correlation, we find that the variance of the lag distribution displays an extreme value that is a consistent early warning indicator of the approaching bifurcation. We demonstrate the reliability of this indicator using different types of models that present different types of bifurcations, including local bifurcations (transcritical, saddle-node, supercritical and subcritical Hopf), and global bifurcations.},

abstract = {The pioneering paper 'Optical rogue waves' by Solli et al (2007 Nature 450 1054) started the new subfield in optics. This work launched a great deal of activity on this novel subject. As a result, the initial concept has expanded and has been enriched by new ideas. Various approaches have been suggested since then. A fresh look at the older results and new discoveries has been undertaken, stimulated by the concept of 'optical rogue waves'. Presently, there may not by a unique view on how this new scientific term should be used and developed. There is nothing surprising when the opinion of the experts diverge in any new field of research. After all, rogue waves may appear for a multiplicity of reasons and not necessarily only in optical fibers and not only in the process of supercontinuum generation. We know by now that rogue waves may be generated by lasers, appear in wide aperture cavities, in plasmas and in a variety of other optical systems. Theorists, in turn, have suggested many other situations when rogue waves may be observed. The strict definition of a rogue wave is still an open question. For example, it has been suggested that it is defined as 'an optical pulse whose amplitude or intensity is much higher than that of the surrounding pulses'. This definition (as suggested by a peer reviewer) is clear at the intuitive level and can be easily extended to the case of spatial beams although additional clarifications are still needed. An extended definition has been presented earlier by N Akhmediev and E Pelinovsky (2010 Eur. Phys. J. Spec. Top. 185 1-4). Discussions along these lines are always useful and all new approaches stimulate research and encourage discoveries of new phenomena. Despite the potentially existing disagreements, the scientific terms 'optical rogue waves' and 'extreme events' do exist. Therefore coordination of our efforts in either unifying the concept or in introducing alternative definitions must be continued. From this point of view, a number of the scientists who work in this area of research have come together to present their research in a single review article that will greatly benefit all interested parties of this research direction. Whether the authors of this 'roadmap' have similar views or different from the original concept, the potential reader of the review will enrich their knowledge by encountering most of the existing views on the subject. Previously, a special issue on optical rogue waves (2013 J. Opt. 15 060201) was successful in achieving this goal but over two years have passed and more material has been published in this quickly emerging subject. Thus, it is time for a roadmap that may stimulate and encourage further research.},

abstract = {Prediction of ecosystem response to global environmental change is a pressing scientific challenge of major societal relevance. Many ecosystems display nonlinear responses to environmental change, and may even undergo practically irreversible ‘regime shifts' that initiate ecosystem collapse. Recently, early warning signals based on spatiotemporal metrics have been proposed for the identification of impending regime shifts. The rapidly increasing availability of remotely sensed data provides excellent opportunities to apply such model-based spatial early warning signals in the real world, to assess ecosystem resilience and identify impending regime shifts induced by global change. Such information would allow land-managers and policy makers to interfere and avoid catastrophic shifts, but also to induce regime shifts that move ecosystems to a desired state. Here, we show that the application of spatial early warning signals in real-world landscapes presents unique and unexpected challenges, and may result in misleading conclusions when employed without careful consideration of the spatial data and processes at hand. We identify key practical and theoretical issues and provide guidelines for applying spatial early warning signals in heterogeneous, real-world landscapes based on literature review and examples from real-world data. Major identified issues include (1) spatial heterogeneity in real-world landscapes may enhance reversibility of regime shifts and boost landscape-level resilience to environmental change (2) ecosystem states are often difficult to define, while these definitions have great impact on spatial early warning signals and (3) spatial environmental variability and socio-economic factors may affect spatial patterns, spatial early warning signals and associated regime shift predictions. We propose a novel framework, shifting from an ecosystem perspective towards a landscape approach. The framework can be used to identify conditions under which resilience assessment with spatial remotely sensed data may be successful, to support well-informed application of spatial early warning signals, and to improve predictions of ecosystem responses to global environmental change.},

abstract = {Multistability is a common phenomenon which naturally occurs in complex networks. Often one of the coexisting stable states can be identified as being the desired one for a particular application. We present here a global approach to identify the minimal perturbation which will instantaneously kick the system out of the basin of attraction of its desired state and hence induce a critical or fatal transition we call shock-tipping. The corresponding Minimal Fatal Shock is a vector whose length can be used as a global stability measure and whose direction in state space allows us to draw conclusions on weaknesses of the network corresponding to critical network motifs. We demonstrate this approach in plant–pollinator networks and the power grid of Great Britain. In both system classes, tree-like substructures appear to be the most vulnerable with respect to the minimal shock perturbation.},

abstract = {It is often known, from modelling studies, that a certain mode of climate tipping (of the oceanic thermohaline circulation, for example) is governed by an underlying fold bifurcation. For such a case, we present a scheme of analysis that determines the best stochastic fit to the existing data. This provides the evolution rate of the effective control parameter, the variation of the stability coefficient and the path itself and its tipping point. By assessing the actual effective level of noise in the available time series, we are then able to make probability estimates of the time of tipping. This new technique is applied, first, to the output of a computer simulation for the end of greenhouse Earth about 34 million years ago when the climate tipped from a tropical state into an icehouse state with ice caps. Second, we use the algorithms to give probabilistic tipping estimates for the end of the most recent glaciation of the Earth using actual geological ice-core data. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author.

abstract = {Early warning signals (EWS) of regime shifts are challenging in cases where the true natural data-generating process is uncertain. Nonparametric drift-diffusion-jump models address this problem by fitting a general model that can approximate a wide range of datagenerating processes. Drift measures the local rate of change. Diffusion measures relatively small shocks that occur at each time step. Jumps are large intermittent shocks. Total variance combines the contributions of diffusion and jumps. Nonparametric methods are well suited to emerging technology for automated, high-frequency sensors. Total variance is the most precisely measured indicator. Jump intensity appears to be a useful EWS. Estimates of the drift are highly uncertain unless long time series with many regime shifts are available. EWS computed from drift estimates (such as autocorrelation coefficients or return rates) have low precision and should be used with caution. Nonetheless, in the current state of knowledge, it is premature to disregard any potential EWS. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

@article{Rubido2018,
abstract = {Finding the correct encoding for a generic dynamical system's trajectory is a complicated task: the symbolic sequence needs to preserve the invariant properties from the system's trajectory. In theory, the solution to this problem is found when a Generating Markov Partition (GMP) is obtained, which is only defined once the unstable and stable manifolds are known with infinite precision and for all times. However, these manifolds usually form highly convoluted Euclidean sets, are a priori unknown, and, as it happens in any real-world experiment, measurements are made with finite resolution and over a finite time-span. The task gets even more complicated if the system is a network composed of interacting dynamical units, namely, a high-dimensional complex system. Here, we tackle this task and solve it by defining a method to approximately construct GMPs for any complex system's finite-resolution and finite-time trajectory. We critically test our method on networks of coupled maps, encoding their trajectories into symbolic sequences. We show that these sequences are optimal because they minimise the information loss and also any spurious information added. Consequently, our method allows us to approximately calculate the invariant probability measures of complex systems from the observed data. Thus, we can efficiently define complexity measures that are applicable to a wide range of complex phenomena, such as the characterisation of brain activity from electroencephalogram signals measured at different brain regions or the characterisation of climate variability from temperature anomalies measured at different Earth regions.},

abstract = {Rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) occurs when time-variation of input parameters of a dynamical system interacts with system timescales to give genuine nonautonomous instabilities. Such instabilities appear as the input varies at some critical rates and cannot, in general, be understood in terms of autonomous bifurcations in the frozen system with a fixed-in-time input. This paper develops an accessible mathematical framework for R-tipping in multidimensional nonautonomous dynamical systems with an autonomous future limit. We focus on R-tipping via loss of tracking of base attractors that are equilibria in the frozen system, due to crossing what we call regular thresholds. These thresholds are associated with regular edge states: compact hyperbolic invariant sets with one unstable direction and orientable stable manifold, that lie on a basin boundary in the frozen system. We define R-tipping and critical rates for the nonautonomous system in terms of special solutions that limit to a compact invariant set of the future limit system that is not an attractor. We focus on the case when the limit set is a regular edge state, which we call the regular R-tipping edge state that anchors the associated regular R-tipping threshold at infinity. We introduce the concept of edge tails to rigorously classify R-tipping into reversible, irreversible, and degenerate cases. The main idea is to compactify the problem and use regular edge states of the future limit system to analyse R-tipping in the nonautonomous system. This allows us to give sufficient conditions for the occurrence of R-tipping in terms of easily testable properties of the frozen system and input variation, and necessary and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of reversible and irreversible R-tipping in terms of computationally verifiable (heteroclinic) connections to regular R-tipping edge states in the compactified system.},

abstract = {Understanding marine regime shifts is important not only for ecology but also for developing marine management that assures the provision of ecosystem services to humanity. While regime shift theory is well developed, there is still no common understanding on drivers, mechanisms and characteristic of abrupt changes in real marine ecosystems. Based on contributions to the present theme issue, we highlight some general issues that need to be overcome for developing a more comprehensive understanding of marine ecosystem regime shifts. We find a great divide between benthic reef and pelagic ocean systems in how regime shift theory is linked to observed abrupt changes. Furthermore, we suggest that the long-lasting discussion on the prevalence of top-down trophic or bottom-up physical drivers in inducing regime shifts may be overcome by taking into consideration the synergistic interactions of multiple stressors, and the special characteristics of different ecosystem types. We present a framework for the holistic investigation of marine regime shifts that considers multiple exogenous drivers that interact with endogenous mechanisms to cause abrupt, catastrophic change. This framework takes into account the time-delayed synergies of these stressors, which erode the resilience of the ecosystem and eventually enable the crossing of ecological thresholds. Finally, considering that increased pressures in the marine environment are predicted by the current climate change assessments, in order to avoid major losses of ecosystem services, we suggest that marine management approaches should incorporate knowledge on environmental thresholds and develop tools that consider regime shift dynamics and characteristics. This grand challenge can only be achieved through a holistic view of marine ecosystem dynamics as evidenced by this theme issue.},

This review covers the observational evidence on climate phenomena and the governing equations of planetary-scale flow and presents the key concept of a hierarchy of models for use in the climate sciences. Recent advances in the application of dynamical systems theory, on the one hand, and nonequilibrium statistical physics, on the other hand, are brought together for the first time and shown to complement each other in helping understand and predict the system's behavior.

abstract = {Call path profiling associates resource consumption with the calling context in which resources were consumed. We describe the design and implementation of a low-overhead call path profiler based on stack sampling. The profiler uses a novel sample-driven strategy for collecting frequency counts for call graph edges without instrumenting every procedure's code to count them. The data structures and algorithms used are efficient enough to construct the complete calling context tree exposed during sampling. The profiler leverages information recorded by compilers for debugging or exception handling to record call path profiles even for highly-optimized code. We describe an implementation for the Tru64/Alpha platform. Experiments profiling the SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite demonstrate the low (2%-7%) overhead of this profiler. A comparison with instrumentation-based profilers, such as gprof, shows that for call-intensive programs, our sampling-based strategy for call path profiling has over an order of magnitude lower overhead.

abstract = {Synthesis The quickly expanding literature on early warning signals for critical transitions in ecosystems suggests that critical slowing down is a key phenomenon to measure the distance to a tipping point in ecosystems. Such work is broadly misinterpreted as showing that slowing down is specific to tipping points. In this contribution, we show why this is not the case. Early warning signals based on critical slowing down indicate a broader class of situations where a system becomes increasingly sensitive to perturbations. Ecosystem responses to external changes can surprise us by their abruptness and irreversibility. Models have helped identifying indicators of impending catastrophic shifts, referred to as 'generic early warning signals'. These indicators are linked to a phenomenon known as 'critical slowing down' which describes the fact that the recovery rate of a system after a perturbation decreases when the system approaches a bifurcation - such as the classical fold bifurcation associated to catastrophic shifts. However, contrary to what has sometimes been suggested in the literature, a decrease in recovery rate cannot be considered as specific to approaching catastrophic shifts. Here, we analyze the behavior of early warning signals based on critical slowing down in systems approaching a range of catastrophic and non-catastrophic situations. Our results show that slowing down generally happens in situations where a system is becoming increasingly sensitive to external perturbations, independently of whether the impeding change is catastrophic or not. These results highlight that indicators specific to catastrophic shifts are still lacking. More importantly, they also imply that in systems where we have no reason to expect catastrophic transitions, slowing down may still be used in a more general sense as a warning signal for a potential decrease in stability. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.},

The method is modified by employing Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) which improves the estimation of short-term decay, especially in climate records which generally possess power-law correlations. When the modified method is applied to GENIE-1 model output that simulates collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, the bifurcation point is correctly anticipated. In Greenland ice core paleotemperature data, for which the conventional degenerate fingerprinting is not applicable due to the short length of the series, the modified method detects the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions. The technique could in principle be used to anticipate future bifurcations in the climate system, but this will require high-resolution time series of the relevant data.

This revolutionary development will allow hyperfast numerical modelling of nonlinear waves, greatly advancing our understanding of oceanic surface and internal waves.

For such a case, we present a scheme of analysis that determines the best stochastic fit to the existing data. This provides the evolution rate of the effective control parameter, the variation of the stability coefficient and the path itself and its tipping point. By assessing the actual effective level of noise in the available time series, we are then able to make probability estimates of the time of tipping. This new technique is applied, first, to the output of a computer simulation for the end of greenhouse Earth about 34 million years ago when the climate tipped from a tropical state into an icehouse state with ice caps. Second, we use the algorithms to give probabilistic tipping estimates for the end of the most recent glaciation of the Earth using actual geological ice-core data. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author.

abstract = {The discussions in the Villefranche Workshop covered a wide range of issues. The term regime shift was originally confined to spatial or temporal correspondences between climatic indices and population abundance. The body of evidence for physical-biological coupling has certainly generated a much better appreciation of the natural decadal scale variability in marine systems. It is difficult, however, to deduce from these time series, the mechanisms or trophic pathways that produce the correspondence. Ideally, we would need experimental manipulations such as those used in small lakes, to unravel the causal connections. Since this is impossible in the open sea, we must use comparisons between systems subject to different types of perturbation or stress. We focused at the Workshop on the effects of over-fishing in different marine regimes. The consequences of large scale changes in community structure imposed by excessive fishing give valuable case studies. Coral reefs, rocky shores, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems provide other examples. The possible existence of similar processes across such diverse systems raises corresponding questions about common ecological principles. The adaptive benefits of maximizing resilience (defined as minimizing the largest eigenvalue of the perturbed system) were considered. The corollary of this assumption is that, at the limits of adaptation, there will be switching between communities, providing a potential ground for a broad definition of regime shifts. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Dakos2017,
abstract = {Despite advances in our mechanistic understanding of ecological processes, the inherent complexity of real-world ecosystems still limits our ability in predicting ecological dynamics especially in the face of on-going environmental stress. Developing a model is frequently challenged by structure uncertainty, unknown parameters, and limited data for exploring out-of-sample predictions. One way to address this challenge is to look for patterns in the data themselves in order to infer the underlying processes of an ecological system rather than to build system-specific models. For example, it has been recently suggested that statistical changes in ecological dynamics can be used to infer changes in the stability of ecosystems as they approach tipping points. For computer scientists such inference is similar to the notion of a Turing machine: a computational device that could execute a program (the process) to produce the observed data (the pattern). Here, we make use of such basic computational ideas introduced by Alan Turing to recognize changing patterns in ecological dynamics in ecosystems under stress. To do this, we use the concept of Kolmogorov algorithmic complexity that is a measure of randomness. In particular, we estimate an approximation to Kolmogorov complexity based on the Block Decomposition Method (BDM). We apply BDM to identify changes in complexity in simulated time-series and spatial datasets from ecosystems that experience different types of ecological transitions. We find that in all cases, KBDM complexity decreased before all ecological transitions both in time-series and spatial datasets. These trends indicate that loss of stability in the ecological models we explored is characterized by loss of complexity and the emergence of a regular and computable underlying structure. Our results suggest that Kolmogorov complexity may serve as tool for revealing changes in the dynamics of ecosystems close to ecological transitions.},

abstract = {Complex systems from different fields of knowledge often do not allow a mathematical description or modeling, because of their intricate structure composed of numerous interacting components. As an alternative approach, it is possible to study the way in which observables associated with the system fluctuate in time. These time series may provide valuable information about the underlying dynamics. It has been suggested that complex dynamic systems, ranging from ecosystems to financial markets and the climate, produce generic early-warning signals at the "tipping points," where they announce a sudden shift toward a different dynamical regime, such as a population extinction, a systemic market crash, or abrupt shifts in the weather. On the other hand, the framework of Self-Organized Criticality (SOC), suggests that some complex systems, such as life itself, may spontaneously converge toward a critical point. As a particular example, the quasispecies model suggests that RNA viruses self-organize their mutation rate near the error-catastrophe threshold, where robustness and evolvability are balanced in such a way that survival is optimized. In this paper, we study the time series associated to a classical discrete quasispecies model for different mutation rates, and identify early-warning signals for critical mutation rates near the error-catastrophe threshold, such as irregularities in the kurtosis and a significant increase in the autocorrelation range, reminiscent of 1/f noise. In the present context, we find that the early-warning signals, rather than broadcasting the collapse of the system, are the fingerprint of survival optimization. {\textcopyright} 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Although considerable effort has been directed towards understanding the physics behind these mysterious and potentially destructive events, the complete picture remains uncertain. Furthermore, rogue waves have not yet been observed in other physical systems. Here, we introduce the concept of optical rogue waves, a counterpart of the infamous rare water waves. Using a new real-time detection technique, we study a system that exposes extremely steep, large waves as rare outcomes from an almost identically prepared initial population of waves. Specifically, we report the observation of rogue waves in an optical system, based on a microstructured optical fibre, near the threshold of soliton-fission supercontinuum generation - a noise-sensitive nonlinear process in which extremely broadband radiation is generated from a narrowband input. We model the generation of these rogue waves using the generalized nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation and demonstrate that they arise infrequently from initially smooth pulses owing to power transfer seeded by a small noise perturbation. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Many natural and technological systems fail to adapt to changing external conditions and move to a different state if the conditions vary too fast. Such 'non-adiabatic' processes are ubiquitous, but little understood. We identify these processes with a new nonlinear phenomenon-an intricate threshold where a forced system fails to adiabatically follow a changing stable state. In systems with multiple time scales, we derive existence conditions that show such thresholds to be generic, but non-obvious, meaning they cannot be captured by traditional stability theory. Rather, the phenomenon can be analysed using concepts from modern singular perturbation theory: folded singularities and canard trajectories, including composite canards. Thus, nonobvious thresholds should explain the failure to adapt to a changing environment in a wide range of multiscale systems including: tipping points in the climate system, regime shifts in ecosystems, excitability in nerve cells, adaptation failure in regulatory genes and adiabatic switching in technology.},

abstract = {The Amazon rainforest has been proposed as a tipping element of the earth system, with the possibility of a dieback of the entire ecosystem due to deforestation only of parts of the rainforest. Possible physical mechanisms behind such a transition are still subject to ongoing debates. Here, we use a specifically designed model to analyse the nonlinear couplings between the Amazon rainforest and the atmospheric moisture transport from the Atlantic to the South American continent. These couplings are associated with a westward cascade of precipitation and evapotranspiration across the Amazon. We investigate impacts of deforestation on the South American monsoonal circulation with particular focus on a previously neglected positive feedback related to condensational latent heating over the rainforest, which strongly enhances atmospheric moisture inflow from the Atlantic. Our results indicate the existence of a tipping point. In our model setup, crossing the tipping point causes precipitation reductions of up to 40% in non-deforested parts of the western Amazon and regions further downstream. The responsible mechanism is the breakdown of the aforementioned feedback, which occurs when deforestation reduces transpiration to a point where the available atmospheric moisture does not suffice anymore to release the latent heat needed to maintain the feedback.},

abstract = {Numerous systems in the climate sciences and elsewhere are excitable, exhibiting coexistence of and transitions between a basic and an excited state. We examine the role of tipping between two such states in an excitable low-order ocean model. Ensemble simulations are used to obtain the model's pullback attractor (PBA) and its properties, as a function of a forcing parameter $$\gamma$$ and of the steepness $$\delta$$ of a climatological drift in the forcing. The tipping time $$t_{\mathrm{{tp}}}$$ is defined as the time at which the transition to relaxation oscillations (ROs) arises: at constant forcing this occurs at $$\gamma =\gamma _{\mathrm{c}}$$ . As the steepness $$\delta$$ decreases, $$t_{\mathrm{{tp}}}$$ is delayed and the corresponding forcing amplitude decreases, while remaining always above $$\gamma _{\mathrm{c}}$$ . With periodic perturbations, that amplitude depends solely on $$\delta$$ over a significant range of parameters: this provides an example of rate-induced tipping in an excitable system. Nonlinear resonance occurs for periods comparable to the RO time scale. Coexisting PBAs and total independence from initial states are found for subsets of parameter space. In the broader context of climate dynamics, the parameter drift herein stands for the role of anthropogenic forcing.},

As a test bed, six previously analysed datasets are reconsidered, three palaeoclimate records approaching abrupt transitions at the end of the last ice age and three models of varying complexity forced through a collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation. Approaches based on examining the lag-1 autocorrelation function or on detrended fluctuation analysis are applied together and compared. The effects of aggregating the data, detrending method, sliding window length and filtering bandwidth are examined. Robust indicators of critical slowing down are found prior to the abrupt warming event at the end of the Younger Dryas, but the indicators are less clear prior to the B{\o} lling-Aller{\o}d warming, or glacial termination in Antarctica. Early warnings of thermohaline circulation collapse can be masked by interannual variability driven by atmospheric dynamics. However, rapidly decaying modes can be successfully filtered out by using a long bandwidth or by aggregating data. The two methods have complementary strengths and weaknesses and we recommend applying them together to improve the robustness of early warnings.{\textcopyright}2012 The Royal Society.},

@techreport{Ritchie2016,
abstract = {A dynamical system is said to undergo rate-induced tipping when it fails to track its quasi-equilibrium state due to an above-critical-rate change of system parameters. We study a prototypical model for rate-induced tipping, the saddle-node normal form subject to time-varying equilibrium drift and noise. We find that both most commonly used early-warning indicators, increase in variance and increase in autocorrelation, occur not when the equilibrium drift is fastest but with a delay. We explain this delay by demonstrating that the most likely trajectory for tipping also crosses the tipping threshold with a delay and therefore the tipping itself is delayed. We find solutions of the variational problem determining the most likely tipping path using numerical continuation techniques. The result is a systematic study of the most likely tipping time in the plane of two parameters, distance from tipping threshold and noise intensity. The notion of tipping describes the phenomenon that at certain critical levels or rates the output of a system changes disproportionately compared to the change in input. Two particular examples in climate science are the possible collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) due to increasing freshwater input or the sudden release of carbon in peatlands due to an external temperature increase above a critical rate (the compost bomb instability 1). There is an ongoing debate, for example, in climate science 2 and ecology 3 whether it is possible to find early-warning indicators robustly in time series of system outputs before tipping occurs. This paper focuses on the case of rate-induced tipping, which describes the scenario where a system fails to track its equilibrium due to a rapid change in parameters. We show that two popular candidates for early-warning indicators in time series, an increase in autocorrelation and an increase in variance, appear to give a delayed warning signal for tipping. We study the phenomenon by looking at the interaction of rate-induced tipping and noise. We find that the most likely time for the noise to kick the system over the threshold (which is a curve in phase space) is after the point where the threshold is closest to the equilibrium. We investigate this tipping (and, correspondingly, early-warning) delay systematically depending on two parameters: the distance of the parameter drift speed from its critical value and the noise intensity. We find that the delay is larger for smaller noise-intensity.},

We test the method on artificial data and then apply it to climate records spanning progressively shorter time periods from 5. 3 Myr ago to the recent observational record. We detect various changes in the number and stability of states in the climate system. The onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation roughly 3 Myr BP is detected as the appearance of a second climate state. During the last ice age in Greenland, there is a bifurcation representing the loss of stability of the warm interstadial state, followed by the total loss of this state around 25 kyr BP. The Holocene is generally characterized by a single stable climate state, especially at large scales. However, in the historical record, at the regional scale, the European monthly temperature anomaly temporarily exhibits a second, highly degenerate (unstable) state during the latter half of the eighteenth century. At the global scale, temperature is currently undergoing a forced movement of a single stable state rather than a bifurcation. The method can be applied to a wide range of geophysical systems with time series of sufficient length and temporal resolution, to look for bifurcations and their precursors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {In this study, a new market representation from persistence homology, known as the L1-norm time series, is used and applied independently with three critical slowing down indicators [autocorrelation function at lag 1, variance, and mean for power spectrum (MPS)] to examine two historical financial crises (Dotcom crash and Lehman Brothers bankruptcy) in the US market. The captured signal is the rising trend in the indicator time series, which can be determined by Kendall's tau correlation test. Furthermore, we examined Pearson's and Spearman's rho correlation tests as potential substitutes for Kendall's tau correlation. After that, we determined a correlation threshold and predicted the whole available date. The point of comparison between these correlation tests is to determine which test is significant and consistent in classifying the rising trend. The results of such a comparison will suggest the best test that can classify the observed rising trend and detect early warning signals (EWSs) of impending financial crises. Our outcome shows that the L1-norm time series is more likely to increase before the two financial crises. Kendall's tau, Pearson's, and Spearman's rho correlation tests consistently indicate a significant rising trend in the MPS time series before the two financial crises. Based on the two evaluation scores (the probability of successful anticipation and probability of erroneous anticipation), by using the L1-norm time series with MPS, our result in the whole prediction demonstrated that Spearman's rho correlation (46.15 and 53.85%) obtains the best score as compared to Kendall's tau (42.31 and 57.69%) and Pearson's (40 and 60%) correlations. Therefore, by using Spearman's rho correlation test, L1-norm time series with MPS is shown to be a better way to detect EWSs of US financial crises.},

We demonstrate the concept experimentally by reporting observations of supervised transitions between waves with different genera.

abstract = {Rogue waves is the name given by oceanographers to isolated large amplitude waves, that occur more frequently than expected for normal, Gaussian distributed, statistical events. Rogue waves are ubiquitous in nature and appear in a variety of different contexts. Besides water waves, they have been recently reported in liquid Helium, in nonlinear optics, microwave cavities, etc. The first part of the review is dedicated to rogue waves in the oceans and to their laboratory counterpart with experiments performed in water basins. Most of the work and interpretation of the experimental results will be based on the nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation, an universal model, that rules the dynamics of weakly nonlinear, narrow band surface gravity waves. Then, we present examples of rogue waves occurring in different physical contexts and we discuss the related anomalous statistics of the wave amplitude, which deviates from the Gaussian behavior that were expected for random waves. The third part of the review is dedicated to optical rogue waves, with examples taken from the supercontinuum generation in photonic crystal fibers, laser fiber systems and two-dimensional spatiotemporal systems. In particular, the extreme waves observed in a two-dimensional spatially extended optical cavity allow us to introduce a description based on two essential conditions for the generation of rogue waves: nonlinear coupling and nonlocal coupling. The first requirement is needed in order to introduce an elementary size, such as that of the solitons or breathers, whereas the second requirement implies inhomogeneity, a mechanism needed to produce the events of mutual collisions and mutual amplification between the elementary solitons or wavepackets. The concepts of "granularity" and "inhomogeneity" as joint generators of optical rogue waves are introduced on the basis of a linear experiment. By extending these concepts to other systems, rogue waves can be classified as phenomena occurring in the presence of many uncorrelated "grains" of activity inhomogeneously distributed in large spatial domains, the "grains" being of linear or nonlinear origin, as in the case of wavepackets or solitons. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In 1993, six Canadian populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) had collapsed to the point where a moratorium was declared on fishing. It has been argued that the collapses were caused by poor recruitment of cod to the fishery. Yet we are unable to detect a difference between the recruitment of year classes that should have contributed most to the spawning stock at the time of the collapse and recruitment levels in earlier years. A power analysis shows that we would have almost certainly detected an overall reduction of recruitment of 20%. There are considerable differences in the abundance trends as determined by research surveys and reconstructed from the commercial catch at age data (called 'virtual population analysis' [VPA]) for each stock. VPA-based abundances consistently depict lower recruitment levels than do survey-based estimates in recent years. More important is the observation that from the early 1980s the VPA-based trend shows a decline where none is apparent in the survey-based trend. One explanation of these differences would be an increase in discarding of young fish as fishing mortality increased. We test the hypothesis that the mortality for young cod is unrelated to the fully recruited fishing mortality. This hypothesis is rejected; in each of the six stocks, high juvenile mortality was associated with high adult mortality. This is consistent with the discarding hypothesis.

In the latter, the spectrum is truncated to only the fundamental frequency and the upper and lower sidebands. Our experiments are performed on deep water waves, which are better described by the higher-order NLSE, the Dysthe equation. We therefore extend our analysis to this system. However, our conclusions are general for NLSE systems. By means of experimentally obtained phase-space trajectories, we demonstrate that forcing and damping cause a separatrix crossing during the evolution. When the system is damped, it is pulled outside the separatrix, which in the real space corresponds to a phase-shift of the envelope and therefore doubles the period of the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou recurrence cycle. When the system is forced by the wind, it is pulled inside the separatrix, lifting the phase-shift. Furthermore, we observe a growth and decay cycle for modulated plane waves that are conventionally considered stable. Finally, we give a theoretical demonstration that forcing the NLSE system can induce symmetry breaking during the evolution.},

abstract = {The possibility of rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) away from an attracting fixed point has been thoroughly explored in 1-dimensional systems. In these systems, it is impossible to have R-tipping away from a path of quasi-stable equilibria that is forward basin stable (FBS), but R-tipping is guaranteed for paths that are non-FBS of a certain type. We will investigate whether these results carry over to multi-dimensional systems. In particular, we will show that the same conditions guaranteeing R-tipping in 1-dimension also guarantee R-tipping in higher dimensions; however, it is possible to have R-tipping away from a path that is FBS even in 2-dimensional systems. We will propose a different condition, forward inflowing stability (FIS), which we show is sufficient to prevent R-tipping in all dimensions. The condition, while natural, is difficult to verify in concrete examples. Monotone systems are a class for which FIS is implied by an easily verifiable condition. As a result, we see how the additional structure of these systems makes predicting the possibility of R-tipping straightforward in a fashion similar to 1-dimension. In particular, we will prove that the FBS and FIS conditions in monotone systems reduce to comparing the relative positions of equilibria over time. An example of a monotone system is given that demonstrates how these ideas are applied to determine exactly when R-tipping is possible.},

That year marks the onset of a rapid deterioration in the capacity of the GICs firn to refreeze meltwater. Consequently, GICs runoff increases 65% faster than meltwater production, tripling the post-1997 mass loss to 36{\textpm}16{\thinspace}Gt−1, or ∼14% of the Greenland total. In sharp contrast, the extensive inland firn of the GrIS retains most of its refreezing capacity for now, buffering 22% of the increased meltwater production.

abstract = {Tipping points have been actively studied in various applications as well as from a mathematical viewpoint. A main technique to theoretically understand early-warning signs for tipping points is to use the framework of fast-slow stochastic differential equations. A key assumption in many arguments for the existence of variance and auto-correlation growth before a tipping point is to use a linearization argument, i.e. the leading-order term governing the deterministic (or drift) part of a stochastic differential equation is linear. This assumption guarantees a local approximation via an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in the normally hyperbolic regime before, but sufficiently bounded away from, a bifurcation. In this paper, we generalize the situation to leading-order nonlinear terms for the setting of one fast variable. We work in the quasi-steady regime and prove that the fast variable has a well-defined stationary distribution and we calculate the scaling law for the variance as a bifurcation-induced tipping point is approached. We cross-validate the scaling law numerically. Furthermore, we provide a computational study for the predictability using early-warning signs for leading-order nonlinear terms based upon receiver-operator characteristic curves.},

As an alternative, we suggest a simple, but highly flexible agent-based model (ABM), which, when applying EWS-analysis, gives reason to (a) consider social interaction, in particular negative feedback effects, as an essential trigger of critical transitions, and (b) to differentiate social interactions, for example in network representations, into a core and a periphery of agents and focus attention on the periphery. Results are tested against time series from a networked version of the Ising-model, which is often used as example for generating hysteretic critical transitions.},

In intermediate and deep water, where waves of different scales may have markedly different breaking probabilities, a BWHD as a function of wave frequency is proposed and validated with intermediate-depth and deep water observational data. The current study focuses on waves with frequencies between 0.55 and 3.45 times the peak frequency fp. For the dominant frequency, the integration of the frequency-dependent BWHD provides a breaking probability that reproduces the known threshold-type behavior of the breaking probability for dominant waves.

abstract = {Many natural systems exhibit tipping points where slowly changing environmental conditions spark a sudden shift to a new and sometimes very different state. As the tipping point is approached, the dynamics of complex and varied systems simplify down to a limited number of possible "normal forms" that determine qualitative aspects of the new state that lies beyond the tipping point, such as whether it will oscillate or be stable. In several of those forms, indicators like increasing lag-1 autocorrelation and variance provide generic early warning signals (EWS) of the tipping point by detecting how dynamics slow down near the transition. But they do not predict the nature of the new state. Here we develop a deep learning algorithm that provides EWS in systems it was not explicitly trained on, by exploiting information about normal forms and scaling behavior of dynamics near tipping points that are common to many dynamical systems. The algorithm provides EWS in 268 empirical and model time series from ecology, thermoacoustics, climatology, and epidemiology with much greater sensitivity and specificity than generic EWS. It can also predict the normal form that characterizes the oncoming tipping point, thus providing qualitative information on certain aspects of the new state. Such approaches can help humans better prepare for, or avoid, undesirable state transitions. The algorithm also illustrates how a universe of possible models can be mined to recognize naturally occurring tipping points.},

These topological changes of the complex networks during this transition can be quantified by calculating the network properties. In this paper, the variation of network properties, namely, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, network diameter, and global efficiency is presented as the system dynamics undergoes transition from combustion noise to thermoacoustic instability.

When the modified method is applied to GENIE-1 model output that simulates collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, the bifurcation point is correctly anticipated. In Greenland ice core paleotemperature data, for which the conventional degenerate fingerprinting is not applicable due to the short length of the series, the modified method detects the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions.

Despite the tremendous effort put into this area, progress has been limited due to the bewildering number of metrics used to describe ecological stability. Here, we seek to resolve some of the confusion by unfolding the dynamics of a simple consumer-resource interaction module. In what follows, we first review common dynamical metrics of stability (CV, eigenvalues). We argue using the classical type II consumer-resource model as an example where the empirical stability metric, CV, hides two different, but important, aspects of stability: (i) stability due to mean population density processes and (ii) stability due to population density variance processes. We then employ a simple stochastic consumer-resource framework in order to elucidate (i) when we expect these two different aspects of stability to arise in ecological systems and, importantly, highlight (ii) the fact that these two different aspects of stability respond differentially, but predictably, to changes in fundamental parameters that govern biomass flux and loss in any consumer-resource interaction (e.g., attack rates, carrying capacity, mortality).},

Using long-term intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from fourteen patients with focal epilepsy, we monitored key signatures of critical slowing down prior to seizures. The metrics used to detect critical slowing down fluctuated over temporally long scales (hours to days), longer than would be detectable in standard clinical evaluation settings. Seizure risk was associated with a combination of these signals together with epileptiform discharges. These results provide strong validation of theoretical models and demonstrate that critical slowing down is a reliable indicator that could be used in seizure forecasting algorithms.},

abstract = {In the age of climate warming, comprehension of ecosystems' future is one of the pressing challenges to humanity. While most studies on climate warming focus on the 'magnitude of change' of the Earth's temperature, the 'rate' at which it is increasing cannot be ruled out. Rapid warming has already caused sudden ecosystem transitions at numerous biodiversity hot spots; a mechanistic understanding of such transitions is crucial. Here, we study a slow-fast consumer-resource ecosystem interacting in rapid warming scenarios. Employing geometric singular perturbation theory, we find that while a gradual change in mean temperature may accord population persistence, a critical warming rate can drive the resource's sudden collapse, termed a warming-induced abrupt transition. This further triggers the bottom-up effect, resulting in the extinction of the consumer. The difference between the optimum temperature of the resource's growth rate and the habitat temperature is crucial in deciding the critical rate of warming. Consequently, species inhabiting extreme temperature regions are more susceptible to warming-induced collapse than those within intermediate temperature ranges. We find that stochastic fluctuations in the system can advance warming-induced transitions, and the efficacy of generic early warning signals to anticipate sudden transitions is challenged.},

abstract = {The literature on the costs of climate change often draws a link between climatic “tipping points” and large economic shocks, frequently called “catastrophes.” The phrase “tipping points” in this context can be misleading. In popular and social scientific discourse, “tipping points” involve abrupt state changes. For some climatic “tipping points,” the commitment to a state change may occur abruptly, but the change itself may be rate-limited and take centuries or longer to realize. Additionally, the connection between climatic “tipping points” and economic losses is tenuous, although emerging empirical and process-model-based tools provide pathways for investigating it. We propose terminology to clarify the distinction between “tipping points” in the popular sense, the critical thresholds exhibited by climatic and social “tipping elements,” and “economic shocks.” The last may be associated with tipping elements, gradual climate change, or nonclimatic triggers. We illustrate our proposed distinctions by surveying the literature on climatic tipping elements, climatically sensitive social tipping elements, and climate–economic shocks, and we propose a research agenda to advance the integrated assessment of all three.},

abstract = {A fast computational method for fully nonlinear non-overturning water waves is derived in two and three dimensions. A corresponding time-stepping scheme is developed in the two-dimensional case. The essential part of the method is a fast converging iterative solution procedure of the Laplace equation. One part of the solution is obtained by fast Fourier transform, while another part is highly nonlinear and consists of integrals with kernels that decay quickly in space. The number of operations required is asymptotically O(N log N), where N is the number of nodes at the free surface. While any accuracy of the computations is achieved by a continued iteration of the equations, one iteration is found to be sufficient for practical computations, while maintaining high accuracy. The resulting explicit approximation of the scheme is tested in two versions. Simulations of nonlinear wave fields with wave slope even up to about unity compare very well with reference computations. The numerical scheme is formulated in such a way that aliasing terms are partially or completely avoided.},

abstract = {The transformation of ecosystems proceeds at unprecedented rates. Recent studies suggest that high rates of environmental change can cause rate-induced tipping. In ecological models, the associated rate-induced critical transition manifests during transient dynamics in which populations drop to dangerously low densities. In this work, we study how indirect evolutionary rescue—due to the rapid evolution of a predator's trait—can save a prey population from the rate-induced collapse. Therefore, we explicitly include the time-dependent dynamics of environmental change and evolutionary adaptation in an eco-evolutionary system. We then examine how fast the evolutionary adaptation needs to be to counteract the response to environmental degradation and express this relationship by means of a critical rate. Based on this critical rate, we conclude that indirect evolutionary rescue is more probable if the predator population possesses a high genetic variation and, simultaneously, the environmental change is slow. Hence, our results strongly emphasize that the maintenance of biodiversity requires a deceleration of the anthropogenic degradation of natural habitats.},

Establishing whether these constitute shifts between alternative stable states is of key importance for the prospects of ecosystem recovery and for management.We show how mechanisms underlying alternative stable states caused by predator-prey interactions can be revealed in field data, using analyses guided by theory on size-structured community dynamics. This is done by combining data on individual performance (such as growth and fecundity) with information on population size and prey availability. We use Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and their prey in the Baltic Sea as an example to discuss and distinguish two types of mechanisms, ‘cultivationdepensation' and ‘overcompensation', that can cause alternative stable states preventing the recovery of overexploited piscivorous fish populations. Importantly, the type of mechanism can be inferred already from changes in the predators' body growth in different life stages. Our approach can thus be readily applied to monitored stocks of piscivorous fish species, for which this information often can be assembled. Using this tool can help resolve the causes of catastrophic collapses in marine predatory-prey systems and guide fisheries managers on how to successfully restore collapsed piscivorous fish stocks.},

abstract = {Early warning signals (EWSs) are a group of statistical time-series signals which could be used to anticipate a critical transition before it is reached. EWSs are model-independent methods that have grown in popularity to support evidence of disease emergence and disease elimination. Theoretical work has demonstrated their capability of detecting disease transitions in simple epidemic models, where elimination is reached through vaccination, to more complex vector transmission, age-structured and metapopulation models. However, the exact time evolution of EWSs depends on the transition; here we review the literature to provide guidance on what trends to expect and when. Recent advances include methods which detect when an EWS becomes significant; the earlier an upcoming disease transition is detected, the more valuable an EWS will be in practice. We suggest that future work should firstly validate detection methods with synthetic and historical datasets, before addressing their performance with real-time data which is accruing. A major challenge to overcome for the use of EWSs with disease transitions is to maintain the accuracy of EWSs in data-poor settings. We demonstrate how EWSs behave on reported cases for pertussis in the USA, to highlight some limitations when detecting disease transitions with real-world data.},

abstract = {We consider the following problem as a model for the slow passage through a steady bifurcation: dy/dt = $\gamma$(t) y - y3 +$\delta$, where $\lambda$ is a slowly increasing function of t given by $\lambda$=$\lambda$i + $\epsilon$t ($\lambda$i,<0). Both $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ are small parameters. This problem is motivated by laser experiments as well as theoretical studies of laser problems. In addition, this equation is a typical amplitude equation for imperfect steady bifurcations with cubic nonlinearities. When $\delta$=0, we have found that $\lambda$=0 is not the point where the bifurcation transition is observed. This transition appears at a value $\lambda$ =$\lambda$j > 0. We call $\lambda$j the delay of the bifurcation transition. We study this delay as a function of $\lambda$i, the initial position of $\lambda$, and $\delta$, the imperfection parameter. To this end, we propose an asymptotic study of this equation as $\delta$ → 0, $\epsilon$ small but fixed. Our main objective is to describe this delay in terms of the relative magnitude of $\delta$ and $\epsilon$. Since time-dependent imperfections are always present in experiments, we analyze in the second part of the paper the effect of a small-amplitude but time-periodic imperfection given by $\delta$(t) = $\delta$ cos($\sigma$t). {\textcopyright} 1987 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

abstract = {Land use change is a principal force and inherent element of global environmental change, threatening biodiversity, natural ecosystems, and their services. However, our ability to anticipate future land use change is severely limited by a lack of understanding of how major socio-economic disturbances (e.g., wars, revolutions, policy changes, and economic crises) affect land use. Here we explored to what extent socio-economic disturbances can shift land use systems onto a different trajectory, and whether this can result in less intensive land use. Our results show that the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused a major reorganization in land use systems. The effects of this socio-economic disturbance were at least as drastic as those of the nuclear disaster in the Chernobyl region in 1986. While the magnitudes of land abandonment were similar in Ukraine and Belarus in the case of the nuclear disaster (28% and 36% of previously farmed land, respectively), the rates of land abandonment after the collapse of the Soviet Union in Ukraine were twice as high as those in Belarus. This highlights that national policies and institutions play an important role in mediating effects of socio-economic disturbances. The socio-economic disturbance that we studied caused major hardship for local populations, yet also presents opportunities for conservation, as natural ecosystems are recovering on large areas of former farmland. Our results illustrate the potential of socio-economic disturbances to revert land use intensification and the important role institutions and policies play in determining land use systems' resilience against such socio-economic disturbances. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Critical slowing down-based early warning signals (EWSs) are well-known indicators that precede an approaching collapse in complex systems. To date, the majority of studies on the predictability of critical transitions consider systems perturbed with temporally uncorrelated noise. In contrast, here we study catastrophic and non-catastrophic transitions, and the performance of associated EWSs in systems perturbed with correlated noise. We find that elevated noise correlation can advance the occurrence of a catastrophic transition, and simultaneously progresses the system's recovery. However, noise correlation does not have a significant impact on the likelihood of non-catastrophic transitions. We show that depending upon the transition mechanism, the occurrence of weak to false signals increases with noise reddening. Imperfect data sampling, both spatial and temporal, further reduces the efficacy of EWSs. Spatially limited data has more impact on the efficacy of EWSs for negative noise correlation than that of positive. However, temporally imperfect data is more detrimental for positively correlated noise. Overall, our study suggests that performance of EWSs is critical to system-specific perturbations as well as data sampling.},

They are the most universal form of soliton that can exist, and are seen in far-from-equilibrium systems in many fields, including chemistry, biology and physics. There has been particular interest in studying their properties in mode-locked lasers, but experiments have been limited by the inability to track the dynamical soliton evolution in real time. Here, we use simultaneous dispersive Fourier transform and time-lens measurements to completely characterize the spectral and temporal evolution of ultrashort dissipative solitons as their dynamics pass through a transient unstable regime with complex break-up and collisions before stabilization. Further insight is obtained from reconstruction of the soliton amplitude and phase and calculation of the corresponding complex-valued eigenvalue spectrum. These findings show how real-time measurements provide new insights into ultrafast transient dynamics in optics.},

abstract = {During its periodic motion, a particle floating at the free surface of a water wave experiences a net drift velocity in the direction of wave propagation, known as the Stokes drift (Stokes 1847 Trans. Camb. Philos. Soc. 8, 441–455). More generally, the Stokes drift velocity is the difference between the average Lagrangian flow velocity of a fluid parcel and the average Eulerian flow velocity of the fluid. This paper reviews progress in fundamental and applied research on the induced mean flow associated with surface gravity waves since the first description of the Stokes drift, now 170 years ago. After briefly reviewing the fundamental physical processes, most of which have been established for decades, the review addresses progress in laboratory and field observations of the Stokes drift. Despite more than a century of experimental studies, laboratory studies of the mean circulation set up by waves in a laboratory flume remain somewhat contentious. In the field, rapid advances are expected due to increasingly small and cheap sensors and transmitters, making widespread use of small surface-following drifters possible. We also discuss remote sensing of the Stokes drift from high-frequency radar. Finally, the paper discusses the three main areas of application of the Stokes drift: in the coastal zone, in Eulerian models of the upper ocean layer and in the modelling of tracer transport, such as oil and plastic pollution. Future climate models will probably involve full coupling of ocean and atmosphere systems, in which the wave model provides consistent forcing on the ocean surface boundary layer. Together with the advent of new space-borne instruments that can measure surface Stokes drift, such models hold the promise of quantifying the impact of wave effects on the global atmosphere–ocean system and hopefully contribute to improved climate projections.

abstract = {Extracting relevant properties of empirical signals generated by nonlinear, stochastic, and high-dimensional systems is a challenge of complex systems research. Open questions are how to differentiate chaotic signals from stochastic ones, and how to quantify nonlinear and/or high-order temporal correlations. Here we propose a new technique to reliably address both problems. Our approach follows two steps: first, we train an artificial neural network (ANN) with flicker (colored) noise to predict the value of the parameter, $\alpha$, that determines the strength of the correlation of the noise. To predict $\alpha$ the ANN input features are a set of probabilities that are extracted from the time series by using symbolic ordinal analysis. Then, we input to the trained ANN the probabilities extracted from the time series of interest, and analyze the ANN output. We find that the $\alpha$ value returned by the ANN is informative of the temporal correlations present in the time series. To distinguish between stochastic and chaotic signals, we exploit the fact that the difference between the permutation entropy (PE) of a given time series and the PE of flicker noise with the same $\alpha$ parameter is small when the time series is stochastic, but it is large when the time series is chaotic. We validate our technique by analysing synthetic and empirical time series whose nature is well established. We also demonstrate the robustness of our approach with respect to the length of the time series and to the level of noise. We expect that our algorithm, which is freely available, will be very useful to the community.},

This complexity appears via non-hyperbolic chaos, randomness, state-dependent persistence and predictability. All these features have prevented a full characterization of the underlying turbulent (stochastic) attractor, which will be the key object to unpin this complexity. Here we use a novel formalism to map unstable fixed points to singularities of turbulent flows and to trace the evolution of their structural characteristics when moving from small to large scales and vice versa, providing a full characterization of the attractor. We demonstrate that the properties of the dynamically invariant objects depend on the scale we are focusing on. Given the changing nature of such attractors in time, space and scale spaces, we term them {\em chameleon} attractors.},

abstract = {Regime shifts are massive, often irreversible, rearrangements of nonlinear ecological processes that occur when systems pass critical transition points. Ecological regime shifts sometimes have severe consequences for human well-being, including eutrophication in lakes, desertification, and species extinctions. Theoretical and laboratory evidence suggests that statistical anomalies may be detectable leading indicators of regime shifts in ecological time series, making it possible to foresee and potentially avert incipient regime shifts. Conditional heteroscedasticity is persistent variance characteristic of time series with clustered volatility. Here, we analyze conditional heteroscedasticity as a potential leading indicator of regime shifts in ecological time series. We evaluate conditional heteroscedasticity by using ecological models with and without four types of critical transition. On approaching transition points, all time series contain significant conditional heteroscedasticity. This signal is detected hundreds of time steps in advance of the regime shift. Time series without regime shifts do not have significant conditional heteroscedasticity. Because probability values are easily associated with tests for conditional heteroscedasticity, detection of false positives in time series without regime shifts is minimized. This property reduces the need for a reference system to compare with the perturbed system. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The University of Chicago.},

The derivation is based on a multi-layer generalization of the traditional columnar Ansatz. A perturbative development in a nonlinear parameter and a dispersive parameter allow us to obtain sets of equations, for the horizontal fluid velocity and the free surface, able to describe propagation of weakly nonlinear and dispersive surface waves moving in water with some prescribed initial constant vorticity. We have shown that vorticity plays a central role on the dispersive properties of the system. When it is weak, it acts as a correction in linear and nonlinear dispersive terms. When stronger, it can also influence the nondispersive behavior of the system. Explicit steady solutions of the system corresponding to zero, weak, normal or strong vorticity are obtained. They correspond to solitary waves. Evolution of the soliton celerity, amplitude and width for these four cases are discussed.},

abstract = {In the Earth's history, periods of relatively stable climate have often been interrupted by sharp transitions to a contrasting state. One explanation for such events of abrupt change is that they happened when the earth system reached a critical tipping point. However, this remains hard to prove for events in the remote past, and it is even more difficult to predict if and when we might reach a tipping point for abrupt climate change in the future. Here, we analyze eight ancient abrupt climate shifts and show that they were all preceded by a characteristic slowing down of the fluctuations starting well before the actual shift. Such slowing down, measured as increased autocorrelation, can be mathematically shown to be a hallmark of tipping points. Therefore, our results imply independent empirical evidence for the idea that past abrupt shifts were associated with the passing of critical thresholds. Because the mechanism causing slowing down is fundamentally inherent to tipping points, it follows that our way to detect slowing down might be used as a universal early warning signal for upcoming catastrophic change. Because tipping points in ecosystems and other complex systems are notoriously hard to predict in other ways, this is a promising perspective. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

The result is that the wave train becomes highly irregular far from its origin, even when the departures from periodicity are scarcely detectable at the start. In this paper a theoretical investigation is made into the stability of periodic wave trains to small disturbances in the form of a pair of side-band modes, and Part 2 which will follow is an account of some experimental observations in accord with the present predictions. The main conclusion of the theory is that infinitesimal disturbances of the type considered will undergo unbounded magnification if 0 <6 <(J2)ka, where k and a are the fundamental wave-number and amplitude of the perturbed wave train. The asymptotic rate of growth is a maximum for 6 = ka.},

abstract = {This paper concerns long time interaction of envelope solitary gravity waves propagating at the surface of a two-dimensional deep fluid in potential flow. Fully nonlinear numerical simulations show how an initially long wave group slowly splits into a number of solitary wave groups. In the example presented, three large wave events are formed during the evolution. They occur during a time scale that is beyond the time range of validity of simplified equations like the nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger (NLS) equation or modifications of this equation. A Fourier analysis shows that these large wave events are caused by significant transfer to side-band modes of the carrier waves. Temporary downshiftings of the dominant wavenumber of the spectrum coincide with the formation large wave events. The wave slope at maximal amplifications is about three times higher than the initial wave slope. The results show how interacting solitary wave groups that emerge from a long wave packet can produce freak wave events. Our reference numerical simulation are performed with the fully nonlinear model of Clamond and Grue [D. Clamond, J. Grue, A fast method for fully nonlinear water wave computations, J. Fluid Mech. 447 (2001) 337-355]. The results of this model are compared with that of two weakly nonlinear models, the NLS equation and its higher-order extension derived by Trulsen et al. [K. Trulsen, I. Kliakhandler, K.B. Dysthe, M.G. Velarde, On weakly nonlinear modulation of waves on deep water, Phys. Fluids 12 (10) (2000) 2432-2437]. They are also compared with the results obtained with a high-order spectral method (HOSM) based on the formulation of West et al. [B.J. West, K.A. Brueckner, R.S. Janda, A method of studying nonlinear random field of surface gravity waves by direct numerical simulation, J. Geophys. Res. 92 (C11) (1987) 11 803-11 824]. An important issue concerning the representation and the treatment of the vertical velocity in the HOSM formulation is highlighted here for the study of long-time evolutions. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier SAS.

Associated with rate-induced tipping (where tracking of a branch of quasistatic attractors breaks down), we find a new phenomenon for attractors that are not simply equilibria: partial tipping of the pullback attractor where certain phases of the periodic attractor tip and others track the quasistatic attractor. For a specific model system with a parameter shift between two asymptotically autonomous systems with periodic attractors, we characterise thresholds of rate-induced tipping to partial and total tipping.

abstract = {We present a new spectral method to simulate numerically the waterwave problem in a channel for a fluid of finite or infinite depth. It is formulated in terms of the free surface elevation $\eta$ and the velocity potential $\phi${symbol}. The numerical method is based on the reduction of this problem to a lower-dimensional computation involving surface variables alone. To accomplish this, we describe the Taylor expansion of the Dirichlet Neumann operator in homogeneous powers of the surface elevation $\eta$. Each term is a concatenation of Fourier multipliers with powers of $\eta$ and its derivatives and is valid uniformly in wavenumber. These are easily calculated using the fast Fourier transform. The method is illustrated by computing the long time evolution of modulated wave packets and of approximations to the Stokes steady wave train. By imposing a surface pressure we observe surface steepening in large amplitude evolution, and wake and bow wave development for flows with a close to critical Froude number. Finally, we give an example of nonlinear evolution of the distribution of energy among normal modes. {\textcopyright} 1993 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

@article{Wieczorek2021,
abstract = {Rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) occurs when time-variation of input parameters of a dynamical system interacts with system timescales to give genuine nonautonomous instabilities. Such instabilities appear as the input varies at some critical rates and cannot, in general, be understood in terms of autonomous bifurcations in the frozen system with a fixed-in-time input. This paper develops an accessible mathematical framework for R-tipping in multidimensional nonautonomous dynamical systems with an autonomous future limit. We focus on R-tipping via loss of tracking of base attractors that are equilibria in the frozen system, due to crossing what we call regular thresholds. These thresholds are associated with regular edge states: compact hyperbolic invariant sets with one unstable direction and orientable stable manifold, that lie on a basin boundary in the frozen system. We define R-tipping and critical rates for the nonautonomous system in terms of special solutions that limit to a compact invariant set of the future limit system that is not an attractor. We focus on the case when the limit set is a regular edge state, which we call the regular R-tipping edge state that anchors the associated regular R-tipping threshold at infinity. We introduce the concept of edge tails to rigorously classify R-tipping into reversible, irreversible, and degenerate cases. The main idea is to compactify the problem and use regular edge states of the future limit system to analyse R-tipping in the nonautonomous system. This allows us to give sufficient conditions for the occurrence of R-tipping in terms of easily testable properties of the frozen system and input variation, and necessary and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of reversible and irreversible R-tipping in terms of computationally verifiable (heteroclinic) connections to regular R-tipping edge states in the compactified system.},

In the field of oceanography and naval architecture, their understanding is fundamental for a correct design of platforms and ships, and for performing safe operations at sea. Here, we report a measurement of an impressive and unique wave packet recorded in the Bay of Biscay in the North-East of the Atlantic Ocean. An analysis of the spatial extension of the packet that includes three large waves reveals that it extents for more than 1 km, with individual crests moving faster than 100 km/h. The central and largest wave in the packet was 27.8 m high in a sea with significant wave height of 11 m. A detailed analysis of the data using the nonlinear Fourier analysis reveals that the wave packet is characterized by a non trivial nonlinear content. This observation opens a new paradigm which requires new understanding of the dynamics of ocean waves and, more in general, of nonlinear and dispersive waves.},

Precise calculations of arrival times are essential for reliable early warning systems, determination of source and earth properties using the inverse problem, and time series modulation due to frequency dependency of phase speed. Far field observatories show a systematic discrepancy between observed and calculated arrival times. Models in present use and based on incompressible hydrodynamics and interaction with a rigid ocean floor overestimate the phase speed of tsunamis, leading to arrival time differences exceeding tens of minutes. These models neglect the simultaneous effects of the slight compressibility of water, sea-bed elasticity, and static compression of the ocean under gravity, hereinafter gravity. Here, we show that taking these effects into account results in more accurate phase speeds and travel times that agree with observations. Moreover, the semi-analytical model that we propose can be employed near real-time, which is essential for early warning inverse models and mitigation systems that rely on accurate phase speed calculations.},

@article{Mukund2018,
abstract = {In pipes, turbulence sets in despite the linear stability of the laminar Hagen-Poiseuille flow. The Reynolds number (Re) for which turbulence first appears in a given experiment - the 'natural transition point' - depends on imperfections of the set-up, or, more precisely, on the magnitude of finite amplitude perturbations. At onset, turbulence typically only occupies a certain fraction of the flow, and this fraction equally is found to differ from experiment to experiment. Despite these findings, Reynolds proposed that after sufficiently long times, flows may settle to steady conditions: below a critical velocity, flows should (regardless of initial conditions) always return to laminar, while above this velocity, eddying motion should persist. As will be shown, even in pipes several thousand diameters long, the spatio-temporal intermittent flow patterns observed at the end of the pipe strongly depend on the initial conditions, and there is no indication that different flow patterns would eventually settle to a (statistical) steady state. Exploiting the fact that turbulent puffs do not age (i.e. they are memoryless), we continuously recreate the puff sequence exiting the pipe at the pipe entrance, and in doing so introduce periodic boundary conditions for the puff pattern. This procedure allows us to study the evolution of the flow patterns for arbitrary long times, and we find that after times in excess of 107 advective time units, indeed a statistical steady state is reached. Although the resulting flows remain spatio-temporally intermittent, puff splitting and decay rates eventually reach a balance, so that the turbulent fraction fluctuates around a well-defined level which only depends on Re. In accordance with Reynolds' proposition, we find that at lower Re (here 2020), flows eventually always resume to laminar, while for higher Re (≥2060), turbulence persists. The critical point for pipe flow hence falls in the interval of 2020 < Re < 2060, which is in very good agreement with the recently proposed value of Rec = 2040. The latter estimate was based on single-puff statistics and entirely neglected puff interactions. Unlike in typical contact processes where such interactions strongly affect the percolation threshold, in pipe flow, the critical point is only marginally influenced. Interactions, on the other hand, are responsible for the approach to the statistical steady state. As shown, they strongly affect the resulting flow patterns, where they cause 'puff clustering', and these regions of large puff densities are observed to travel across the puff pattern in a wave-like fashion.},

This derivation is able to explain the presence of multiple states in fully developed turbulence and the selection of one state over another by differently sized computational domains and different initial conditions. According to the present derivation, two and only two statistically stable states are possible in an infinitely large plane Couette flow with spanwise rotation, and that multiple states are not possible at very slow or very rapid rotation speeds.

abstract = {The most commonly used wave dispersion relation, k 0 h = kh tanh(kh), has been closely approximated as an explicit formula for direct calculation of wave number k in any coastal water depth h by using two different root-finding methods. One explicit formula derived with the Newton-Raphson method has a maximum relative error of only 0.01% in calculating k in any water depth. This is the most accurate explicit one proposed so far and should be used to compute k in wave-related models that require a large of number of wavelength calculations. The other explicit formula derived with the one-point iteration method has a maximum relative error of 0.1%, but is of a simple form and can be easily applied to compute k in any water depth with a hand calculator. The validity of the wave dispersion relation under the coastal conditions is also investigated based on the comprehensive field data on wave pressure and orbital velocity.},

Spectral methods are used in combination with either second order perturbation series or fully-nonlinear High-Order Spectral method. Such techniques involve quick FFT resolution permitting accurate simulations of wave fields at low cost. Both second order and fully nonlinear Numerical Wave Tanks are developed. Such models feature all the physical characteristics of a wavetank (snake wave-maker, experimentally calibrated absorbing zone, etc.). Several validation results are presented where numerical simulations are successfully compared to experiments on different 2D and 3D complex sea-states. A periodic domain HOS modelling of open ocean wavefields is then applied to simulate long-time evolutions of 3D ocean in order to study the formation of freak waves. An investigation of the influence of directionality on these extreme wave events is shown through a study of the number and 3D shape of the detected freak waves.},

@article{Zakharov1968,
abstract = {We study the stability of steady nonlinear waves on the surface of an infinitely deep fluid [1, 2]. In section 1, the equations of hydrodynamics for an ideal fluid with a free surface are transformed to canonical variables: the shape of the surface $\eta$(r, t) and the hydrodynamic potential $\psi$(r, t) at the surface are expressed in terms of these variables. By introducing canonical variables, we can consider the problem of the stability of surface waves as part of the more general problem of nonlinear waves in media with dispersion [3,4]. The resuits of the rest of the paper are also easily applicable to the general case. In section 2, using a method similar to van der Pohl's method, we obtain simplified equations describing nonlinear waves in the small amplitude approximation. These equations are particularly simple if we assume that the wave packet is narrow. The equations have an exact solution which approximates a periodic wave of finite amplitude. In section 3 we investigate the instability of periodic waves of finite amplitude. Instabilities of two types are found. The first type of instability is destructive instability, similar to the destructive instability of waves in a plasma [5, 6], In this type of instability, a pair of waves is simultaneously excited, the sum of the frequencies of which is a multiple of the frequency of the original wave. The most rapid destructive instability occurs for capillary waves and the slowest for gravitational waves. The second type of instability is the negative-pressure type, which arises because of the dependence of the nonlinear wave velocity on the amplitude; this results in an unbounded increase in the percentage modulation of the wave. This type of instability occurs for nonlinear waves through any media in which the sign of the second derivative in the dispersion law with respect to the wave number (d2$\omega$/dk2) is different from the sign of the frequency shift due to the nonlinearity. As announced by A. N. Litvak and V. I. Talanov [7], this type of instability was independently observed for nonlinear electromagnetic waves. {\textcopyright} 1972 Consultants Bureau.},

abstract = {The net movement of Lagrangian particles under water waves comprises a Stokes drift in the direction of wave propagation and an Eulerian return flow in the opposing direction. Accurate prediction of the Eulerian return flow in the ocean is of importance in modeling the transport of plastic pollution, oil, wreckage, and sediment. Herein, we derive a multiple-scales solution for the Eulerian mean flow under wave packets that is valid for all water depths, relative to both the length of the wave and the length of the wave packet. To validate this solution, we carry out particle tracking velocimetry experiments in a long flume to extract the mean motion from Lagrangian seeding particles under wave packets, finding good agreement. The extraction technique is able to deal with small background motion and subharmonic error waves associated with wave generation by the paddle, the latter being relatively large in finite-depth flume experiments. In finite depth, the return flow is forced by both the divergence of the Stokes transport on the wave-packet scale and the formation of a non-negligible mean set-down underneath the packet, which acts like a bounding streamtube in the form of a convergent-divergent duct. The magnitude of the horizontal return flow is thus enhanced, with particular relevance to transport in the finite-depth coastal environment.},

abstract = {We study statistical properties after a sudden episode of wind for water waves propagating in one direction. A wave with random initial conditions is propagated using a forced-damped higher-order nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. During the wind episode, the wave action increases, the spectrum broadens, the spectral mean shifts up, and the Benjamin-Feir index (BFI) and the kurtosis increase. Conversely, after the wind episode, the opposite occurs for each quantity. The kurtosis of the wave height distribution is considered the main parameter that can indicate whether rogue waves are likely to occur in a sea state, and the BFI is often mentioned as a means to predict the kurtosis. However, we find that while there is indeed a quadratic relation between these two, this relationship is dependent on the details of the forcing and damping. Instead, a simple and robust quadratic relation does exist between the kurtosis and the bandwidth. This could allow for a single-spectrum assessment of the likelihood of rogue waves in a given sea state. In addition, as the kurtosis depends strongly on the damping and forcing coefficients, by combining the bandwidth measurement with the damping coefficient, the evolution of the kurtosis after the wind episode can be predicted.},

abstract = {Our overall objective is to find mathematical models that describe accurately how waves in nature propagate and evolve. One process that affects evolution is dissipation (Segur et al., J Fluid Mech 539:229-271, 2005), so in this paper we explore several models in the literature that incorporate various dissipative physical mechanisms. In particular, we seek theoretical models that (1) agree with measured dissipation rates in laboratory and field experiments, and (2) have the mathematical properties required to be of use in weakly nonlinear models of the evolution of waves with narrow-banded spectra, as they propagate over long distances on deep water.},

Formula (1) gives the disspation rate as a function of tank width and depth (in kH). It is in good agreement with what is experimentally found (the dashed line in figure 1, with small additions due to surface contamaninations)},
