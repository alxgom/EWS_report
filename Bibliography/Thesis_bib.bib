   abstract = {We discuss some consequences of the canonical transformation in the Hamiltonian theory of water waves (Zakharov, J. Appl. Mech. Tech. Phys., vol. 9, 1968, pp. 190–194). Using Krasitskii's canonical transformation we derive general expressions for the second-order wavenumber and frequency spectrum and the skewness and the kurtosis of the sea surface. For deep-water waves, the second-order wavenumber spectrum and the skewness play an important role in understanding the so-called sea-state bias as seen by a radar altimeter. According to the present approach but in contrast with results obtained by Barrick &amp; Weber (J. Phys. Oceanogr., vol. 7, 1977, pp. 11–21), in deep water second-order effects on the wavenumber spectrum are relatively small. However, in shallow water in which waves are more nonlinear, the second-order effects are relatively large and help to explain the formation of the observed second harmonics and infra-gravity waves in the coastal zone. The second-order effects on the directional-frequency spectrum are as a rule more important; in particular it is shown how the Stokes-frequency correction affects the shape of the frequency spectrum, and it is also discussed why in the context of the second-order theory the mean-square slope cannot be estimated from time series. The kurtosis of the wave field is a relevant parameter in the detection of extreme sea states. Here, it is argued that in contrast perhaps to one's intuition, the kurtosis decreases while the waves approach the coast. This is related to the generation of the wave-induced current and the associated change in mean sea level.},

   abstract = {Theoretical distributions proposed for describing the crest-to-trough heights of linear waves are reviewed briefly. To explore the effects of nonlinearities, these are generalized to second-order waves, utilizing quasi-deterministic results on the expected shape of large waves. The efficacy of Gram-Charlier models in describing the effects of third-order nonlinearities on the distributions of wave heights, crests and troughs are examined in detail. All models and a fifth-order Stokes-Rayleigh type model recently proposed are compared with linear and nonlinear waves simulated from the JONSWAP spectrum representative of long-crested extreme seas, and also with oceanic data gathered in the North Sea. Uncertainties arising from the variability of probability estimates derived from sample populations of limited size are considered. Ultimately, the comparisons show that nonlinearities do not have any discernable effect on the crest-to-trough heights of oceanic waves. Most of the linear models considered yield similar and reasonable predictions of the observed data trends. Gram-Charlier type distributions seem neither effective nor particularly useful in describing the statistics of large wave heights or crests under oceanic conditions. However, they do surprisingly well in predicting unusually large wave heights and crests observed in some 2D wave-flume experiments and 3D numerical simulations of long-crested narrow-band random waves. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {A theoretical expression derived previously for describing the joint distribution of the envelope and phase of second-order nonlinear waves is verified with wind wave measurements gathered in the North Sea. The same distribution is explored further to obtain the marginal and conditional distributions of wave envelopes and phases. The nature and implications of these are examined, with emphasis on the occurrence of large waves and associated phases. It is shown that the wave phase distribution assumes two distinct forms depending on whether envelope heights exceed the significant envelope height. For envelope heights sufficiently larger than this threshold, the wave phase distribution approaches a simple limit form, indicating that large surface displacements can occur only above the mean sea level. Comparisons with the North Sea data confirm these theoretical results and indicate that large surface displacements and thus large waves result from the random superposition of elementary spectral components enhanced by second-order nonlinear interactions. Further, large waves with higher and sharper crests do not display any secondary maxima or minima. They appear more regular or "narrow banded" than relatively low waves, and their heights and crests do not violate the Miche-Stokes-type upper limits. The results also suggest that third-order nonlinearities do not affect the surface statistics in any discernable way. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {A review of physical mechanisms of the rogue wave phenomenon is given. The data of marine observations as well as laboratory experiments are briefly discussed. They demonstrate that freak waves may appear in deep and shallow waters. Simple statistical analysis of the rogue wave probability based on the assumption of a Gaussian wave field is reproduced. In the context of water wave theories the probabilistic approach shows that numerical simulations of freak waves should be made for very long times on large spatial domains and large number of realizations. As linear models of freak waves the following mechanisms are considered: dispersion enhancement of transient wave groups, geometrical focusing in basins of variable depth, and wave-current interaction. Taking into account nonlinearity of the water waves, these mechanisms remain valid but should be modified. Also, the influence of the nonlinear modulational instability (Benjamin-Feir instability) on the rogue wave occurence is discussed. Specific numerical simulations were performed in the framework of classical nonlinear evolution equations: the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, the Davey-Stewartson system, the Korteweg-de Vries equation, the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, the Zakharov equation, and the fully nonlinear potential equations. Their results show the main features of the physical mechanisms of rogue wave phenomenon. © 2003 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We present a second-order stochastic model of weakly nonlinear waves and develop theoretical expressions for the expected shape of large surface displacements. The model also leads to an exact theoretical expression for the statistical distribution of large wave crests in a form that generalizes the Tayfun distribution (Tayfun, J. Geophys. Res., vol. 85, 1980, p. 1548). The generalized distribution depends on a steepness parameter given by μ = λ3/3, where λ3 represents the skewness coefficient of surface displacements. It converges to the Tayfun distribution in narrowband waves, where both distributions describe the crests of all waves well. In broadband waves, the generalized distribution represents the crests of large waves just as well whereas the Tayfun distribution appears as an upper bound and tends to overestimate them. However, the theoretical nature of the generalized distribution presents practical difficulties in oceanic applications. We circumvent these by adopting an appropriate approximation for the steepness parameter. Comparisons with wind-wave measurements from the North Sea suggest that this approximation allows both distributions to assume an identical form with which we can describe the distribution of large wave crests fairly accurately. The same comparisons also show that third-order nonlinear effects do not appear to have any discernable effect on the statistics of large surface displacements or wave crests.},

The computational effort is directly proportional to N and M, and the convergence with N and M is exponentially fast for waves up to approximately 80% of Stokes limiting steepness (ka ∼ 0.35). The efficiency and accuracy of the method is demonstrated by comparisons to fully nonlinear semi-Lagrangian computations (Vinje &amp; Brevig 1981); calculations of long-time evolution of wavetrains using the modified (fourth-order) Zakharov equations (Stiassnie &amp; Shemer 1987); and experimental measurements of a travelling wave packet (Su 1982).

   abstract = {We study the stability of steady nonlinear waves on the surface of an infinitely deep fluid [1, 2]. In section 1, the equations of hydrodynamics for an ideal fluid with a free surface are transformed to canonical variables: the shape of the surface η(r, t) and the hydrodynamic potential ψ(r, t) at the surface are expressed in terms of these variables. By introducing canonical variables, we can consider the problem of the stability of surface waves as part of the more general problem of nonlinear waves in media with dispersion [3,4]. The resuits of the rest of the paper are also easily applicable to the general case. In section 2, using a method similar to van der Pohl's method, we obtain simplified equations describing nonlinear waves in the small amplitude approximation. These equations are particularly simple if we assume that the wave packet is narrow. The equations have an exact solution which approximates a periodic wave of finite amplitude. In section 3 we investigate the instability of periodic waves of finite amplitude. Instabilities of two types are found. The first type of instability is destructive instability, similar to the destructive instability of waves in a plasma [5, 6], In this type of instability, a pair of waves is simultaneously excited, the sum of the frequencies of which is a multiple of the frequency of the original wave. The most rapid destructive instability occurs for capillary waves and the slowest for gravitational waves. The second type of instability is the negative-pressure type, which arises because of the dependence of the nonlinear wave velocity on the amplitude; this results in an unbounded increase in the percentage modulation of the wave. This type of instability occurs for nonlinear waves through any media in which the sign of the second derivative in the dispersion law with respect to the wave number (d2ω/dk2) is different from the sign of the frequency shift due to the nonlinearity. As announced by A. N. Litvak and V. I. Talanov [7], this type of instability was independently observed for nonlinear electromagnetic waves. © 1972 Consultants Bureau.},

Thus, a slight perturbation on the ocean surface can dramatically increase the amplitude of the singular wave event that appears as a result. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Equations governing modulations of weakly nonlinear water waves are described. The modulations are coupled with wave-induced mean flows except in the case of water deeper than the modulation length scale. Equations suitable for water depths of the order the modulation length scale are deduced from those derived by Davey and Stewartson [5] and Dysthe [6]. A number of ases in which these equations reduce to a one dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation are enumerated.Several analytical solutions of NLS equations are presented, with discussion of some of their implications for describing the propagation of water waves. Some of the solutions have not been presented in detail, or in convenient form before. One is new, a “rational” solution describing an “amplitude peak” which is isolated in space-time. Ma's [13] soli ton is particularly relevant to the recurrence of uniform wave trains in the experiment of Lake et al.[10].In further discussion it is pointed out that although water waves are unstable to three-dimensional disturbances, an effective description of weakly nonlinear two-dimensional waves would be a useful step towards describing ocean wave propagation.},

Spectral methods are used in combination with either second order perturbation series or fully-nonlinear High-Order Spectral method. Such techniques involve quick FFT resolution permitting accurate simulations of wave fields at low cost. Both second order and fully nonlinear Numerical Wave Tanks are developed. Such models feature all the physical characteristics of a wavetank (snake wave-maker, experimentally calibrated absorbing zone, etc.). Several validation results are presented where numerical simulations are successfully compared to experiments on different 2D and 3D complex sea-states. A periodic domain HOS modelling of open ocean wavefields is then applied to simulate long-time evolutions of 3D ocean in order to study the formation of freak waves. An investigation of the influence of directionality on these extreme wave events is shown through a study of the number and 3D shape of the detected freak waves.},

   abstract = {We study statistical properties after a sudden episode of wind for water waves propagating in one direction. A wave with random initial conditions is propagated using a forced-damped higher-order nonlinear Schrödinger equation. During the wind episode, the wave action increases, the spectrum broadens, the spectral mean shifts up, and the Benjamin-Feir index (BFI) and the kurtosis increase. Conversely, after the wind episode, the opposite occurs for each quantity. The kurtosis of the wave height distribution is considered the main parameter that can indicate whether rogue waves are likely to occur in a sea state, and the BFI is often mentioned as a means to predict the kurtosis. However, we find that while there is indeed a quadratic relation between these two, this relationship is dependent on the details of the forcing and damping. Instead, a simple and robust quadratic relation does exist between the kurtosis and the bandwidth. This could allow for a single-spectrum assessment of the likelihood of rogue waves in a given sea state. In addition, as the kurtosis depends strongly on the damping and forcing coefficients, by combining the bandwidth measurement with the damping coefficient, the evolution of the kurtosis after the wind episode can be predicted.},

Increasing the laser peak power broadens the spectrum while the beam approaches the filamentation regime. We identify two regimes for this transition: In the center of the spectrum, the output spectral intensity increases continuously. In contrast, on the edges of the spectrum the transition implies a bimodal probability distribution function for intermediate incident pulse energies, where a high-intensity mode appears and grows at the expense of the original low-intensity mode. We argue that this dual behavior prevents the definition of a univoquial threshold for filamentation, shedding a new light on the long-standing lack of explicit definition of the boundary of the filamentation regime.},

Precise calculations of arrival times are essential for reliable early warning systems, determination of source and earth properties using the inverse problem, and time series modulation due to frequency dependency of phase speed. Far field observatories show a systematic discrepancy between observed and calculated arrival times. Models in present use and based on incompressible hydrodynamics and interaction with a rigid ocean floor overestimate the phase speed of tsunamis, leading to arrival time differences exceeding tens of minutes. These models neglect the simultaneous effects of the slight compressibility of water, sea-bed elasticity, and static compression of the ocean under gravity, hereinafter gravity. Here, we show that taking these effects into account results in more accurate phase speeds and travel times that agree with observations. Moreover, the semi-analytical model that we propose can be employed near real-time, which is essential for early warning inverse models and mitigation systems that rely on accurate phase speed calculations.},

Strong evidence is given that the rogue waves observed in the tank are hydrodynamic instantons, that is, saddle point configurations of the action associated with the stochastic model of the wave system. As shown here, these hydrodynamic instantons are complex spatiotemporal wave field configurations which can be defined using the mathematical framework of large deviation theory and calculated via tailored numerical methods. These results indicate that the instantons describe equally well rogue waves created by simple linear superposition (in weakly nonlinear conditions) or by nonlinear focusing (in strongly nonlinear conditions), paving the way for the development of a unified explanation to rogue wave formation.},

At low energies and in the long delay limit, a multiscale analysis shows the equivalence with the nonlinear Schrödinger equation.

@article{Friedland1992,
   abstract = {The autoresonance in nonlinear three-wave interactions is discussed. The phenomenon is characteristic of inhomogeneous (or time-dependent) media in the presence of nonlinear wave-vector (frequency) shifts and leads to a persistent and efficient redistribution of the wave action fluxes (action densities) via a continuing spatial (temporal) self-adjustment of the nonlinear resonance relation. Conditions for the autoresonance are found and the phenomenon is illustrated by numerical examples. PACS numbers: 03.40.Kf, 52.35.Mw Nonlinear three-wave resonant interactions (3WRI) are of great importance, since they describe the lowest order (in terms of wave amplitudes) nonlinear effects in the evolution of perturbations in many physical systems [1]. Historically, the theory of the 3WRI proceeded from homogeneous and time-independent equilibria, through the inclusion of a one-dimensional inhomogeneity [2,3] and nonlinear frequency shifts [4], and, finally, to the three-dimensional evolution of the interaction in uniform [1] and one-dimensional [5] media. A 3WRI process requires satisfaction of the resonance relations cu~ =to2+to3 and k~ =k2+k3 for the frequencies and wave vectors of the interacting waves. Therefore, any factor afl'ecting these relations makes a large influence on the 3WRI. Inhomogeneity, for example, limits the efl'ective spatial three-wave interaction range as the wave vectors detune from the exact resonance relation. A classical application of this phenomenon is the stabilization of the explosive instability (one of the important cases of the 3WRI) by an inhomogeneity [2]. Nonlinear frequency shifts are also known to stabilize the explosive instability [4] because of the dependence of the resonance relations on the amplitudes of the waves. Our goal is to consider the combined effect of inhomogeneity (or time dependence) of the medium and nonlinearity of the wave dispersions on the 3WRI. We shall see that the width of the resonant interaction region in an inhomogeneous medium can be significantly broadened or even become infinite, with the addition of the nonlinearity, provided the system enters the autaresonant interaction regime (hereafter referred to as the 3WARI). The autoreso-nance phenomenon was studied previously in the context of accelerators [6], atomic physics [7], nonlinear dynamics [81, and pairwise mode conversion [9], and this Letter presents an extension of the idea to the 3WRI. The starting point of our theory is the system of 3WRI equations in a one-dimensional, weakly inhomogeneous and slowly time-dependent medium, L)(D()A)+i(D~+BD~)A~ = cA2Aex3(ip%'), (2) where s; and p; are the signs of the group velocities v; =-(t)D;/1)k;)/(|)D;/&to;) and action densities W; =-(tJD;/rJto;) l A; l of the three waves, respectively, A =I'D;/ak; I'"A;, '= l(aD, /ek,)(aD,Irk,)(aD,/ t)k 3) l ', and the nonlinear wave vector shifts are defined via 6k; =p;6D; l (t)D, /t)k,) l-'. Now, for simplicity, let us further restrict the analysis to the situation when s; & 0 (the three waves propagate in the positive x direction) and introduce the absolute values B; and complex phases p; of the wave amplitudes. Then (2) yields the following system of real equations: &&exp[Itt(x, t)] for which D;(k;, to;;x, t) are the real linear local dispersion functions, bD; are the lowest-order real nonlinear corrections to D;, k;=t)@;/|)x and co; =-t)@;/i)t are the wave vectors and frequencies, c is the complex wave coupling coeflicient, and + =+2+ 0 3 The operators L; in (1) are defined via L, , (D,) =-(eD, /a~,)(a/at)+ (aD;/ak;) (a/ax)-, ' [d(BD,/r)to,)/dt-d (r)D, /r)k,)/dx]. In the case c=bD; =0, Eqs. (1) describe three indepen dent geometric-optics modes [10] and the solution of the problem can be found by integrating along the rays for which D; =0 serve as Hamiltonians. For a weak non-linearity, we can still define to; and k; by the ray equations of the linear problem, i.e. , set D; =0 in (1) for nonzero c and 6D;. At this stage, we reduce the complexity of the problem and consider a stationary, but weakly x-dependent background case (a uniform, but time-dependent situation can be treated similarly). Then A;=A;(x), tu;=const, and D;(k;, to;;x) =0 is viewed as the equation for k;=k;(x).

In the field of oceanography and naval architecture, their understanding is fundamental for a correct design of platforms and ships, and for performing safe operations at sea. Here, we report a measurement of an impressive and unique wave packet recorded in the Bay of Biscay in the North-East of the Atlantic Ocean. An analysis of the spatial extension of the packet that includes three large waves reveals that it extents for more than 1 km, with individual crests moving faster than 100 km/h. The central and largest wave in the packet was 27.8 m high in a sea with significant wave height of 11 m. A detailed analysis of the data using the nonlinear Fourier analysis reveals that the wave packet is characterized by a non trivial nonlinear content. This observation opens a new paradigm which requires new understanding of the dynamics of ocean waves and, more in general, of nonlinear and dispersive waves.},

Several tipping points may be triggered in the Paris Agreement range of 1.5 to <2°C global warming, with many more likely at the 2 to 3°C of warming expected on current policy trajectories. This strengthens the evidence base for urgent action to mitigate climate change and to develop improved tipping point risk assessment, early warning capability, and adaptation strategies.},

The difference between the optimum temperature of the resource's growth rate and the habitat temperature is crucial in deciding the critical rate of warming.

These topological changes of the complex networks during this transition can be quantified by calculating the network properties. In this paper, the variation of network properties, namely, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, network diameter, and global efficiency is presented as the system dynamics undergoes transition from combustion noise to thermoacoustic instability. These network properties capture the change in system dynamics well before the rise in pressure amplitude levels in the combustors. These network properties can be used as early warning signals to detect the onset of impending thermoacoustic instabilities.},

We focus on these early warning signals, and the challenges faced while detecting oscillatory instabilities in practical systems. In contrast to the transition from a fixed point to limit cycle oscillations in laminar systems, turbulent systems exhibit a transition from a chaotic state to limit cycle via a state of intermittency.

   abstract = {There is a long history in ecology of using mathematical models to identify deterministic processes that may lead to dramatic population dynamic patterns like boom-and-bust outbreaks. Stochasticity is also well-known to have a significant influence on the dynamics of many ecological systems, but this aspect has received far less attention. Here, we study a stochastic version of a classic bistable insect outbreak model to reveal the role of stochasticity in generating outbreak dynamics. We find that stochasticity has strong effects on the dynamics and that the stochastic system can behave in ways that are not easily anticipated by its deterministic counterpart. Both the intensity and autocorrelation of the stochastic environment are important. Stochasticity with higher intensity (variability) generally weakens bistability, causing the dynamics to spend more time at a single state rather than jumping between alternative stable states. Which state the population tends toward depends on the noise color. High-intensity white noise causes the insect population to spend more time at low density, potentially reducing the severity or frequency of outbreaks. However, red (positively autocorrelated) noise can make the population spend more time near the high density state, intensifying outbreaks. Under neither type of noise do early warning signals reliably predict impending outbreaks or population crashes.},

   abstract = {Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is exploited to determine the global stability threshold Rg of plane Couette flow - the flow of a viscous fluid in the space between two parallel plates - whose laminar or turbulent behavior depends on the Reynolds number R. Even if the existence of a global stability threshold has been detected in simulations and experiments, its numerical value has not been unequivocally defined. Rg is the value such that for R>Rg, turbulence is sustained, whereas for R<Rg it is transient and eventually decays. We address the problem of determining R g by using the extremes - maxima and minima - of the perturbation energy fluctuations. When R≫Rg, both the positive and negative extremes are bounded. As the critical Reynolds number is approached from above, the probability of observing a very low minimum increases causing asymmetries in the distributions of maxima and minima. On the other hand, the maxima distribution is unaffected as the fluctuations towards higher values of the perturbation energy remain bounded. This tipping point can be detected by fitting the data to the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution and by identifying Rg as the value of R such that the shape parameter of the GEV for the minima changes sign from negative to positive. The results are supported by the analysis of theoretical models which feature a bistable behavior. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Early warning signals (EWSs) have the potential to predict tipping points where catastrophic changes occur in ecological systems. However, EWSs are plagued by false negatives, leading to undetected catastrophes. One reason may be because EWSs do not occur equally for all species in a system, so whether and how strongly EWSs are detected depends on which species is being observed. Here, we illustrate how the strength of EWSs is determined by each species’ relationship to properties of the noise, the system’s response to that noise, and the occurrence of critical slowing down (the dynamical phenomenon that gives rise to EWSs). Using these relationships, we present general rules for maximizing EWS detection in ecological communities. We find that for two-species competitive and mutualistic systems, one should generally monitor the species experiencing smaller intraspecific effects to maximize EWS performance, while in consumer-resource systems, one should monitor the species imposing the smaller interspecific effects. These guidelines appear to hold for at least some larger communities as well. We close by extending the theoretical basis for our rules to systems with any number of species and more complex forms of noise. Our findings provide important guidance on how to monitor systems for EWSs to maximize detection of tipping points.},

   abstract = {Amazon forest dieback is seen as a potential tipping point under climate change. These concerns are partly based-on an early coupled climate-carbon cycle simulation, that produced unusually strong drying and warming in Amazonia. In contrast, the 5th generation Earth System Models (CMIP5) produced few examples of Amazon dieback under climate change. Here we examine results from seven 6th generation models (CMIP6) which include vegetation dynamics, and in some cases interactive forest fires. Although these models typically project increases in area-mean forest carbon across Amazonia under CO2-induced climate change, five of the seven models also produce abrupt reductions in vegetation carbon which indicate localised dieback events. The Northern South America region (NSA), which contains most of the rainforest, is especially vulnerable in the models. These dieback events, some of which are mediated by fire, are preceded by an increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in near surface temperature, which is consistent with more extreme dry seasons. Based-on the ensemble mean of the detected dieback events we estimate that 7 +/-5% of the NSA region will experience abrupt downward shifts in vegetation carbon per degree of global warming above 1.5 degrees.},

The captured signal is the rising trend in the indicator time series, which can be determined by Kendall's tau correlation test. Furthermore, we examined Pearson's and Spearman's rho correlation tests as potential substitutes for Kendall's tau correlation. After that, we determined a correlation threshold and predicted the whole available date. The point of comparison between these correlation tests is to determine which test is significant and consistent in classifying the rising trend. The results of such a comparison will suggest the best test that can classify the observed rising trend and detect early warning signals (EWSs) of impending financial crises. Our outcome shows that the L1-norm time series is more likely to increase before the two financial crises. Kendall's tau, Pearson's, and Spearman's rho correlation tests consistently indicate a significant rising trend in the MPS time series before the two financial crises. Based on the two evaluation scores (the probability of successful anticipation and probability of erroneous anticipation), by using the L1-norm time series with MPS, our result in the whole prediction demonstrated that Spearman's rho correlation (46.15 and 53.85%) obtains the best score as compared to Kendall's tau (42.31 and 57.69%) and Pearson's (40 and 60%) correlations. Therefore, by using Spearman's rho correlation test, L1-norm time series with MPS is shown to be a better way to detect EWSs of US financial crises.},

   abstract = {Early detection of bifurcations and chaos and understanding their topological characteristics are essential for safe and reliable operation of various electrical, chemical, physical, and industrial processes. However, the presence of non-linearity and high-dimensionality in system behavior makes this analysis a challenging task. The existing methods for dynamical system analysis provide useful tools for anomaly detection (e.g., Bendixson-Dulac and Poincare-Bendixson criteria can detect the presence of limit cycles); however, they do not provide a detailed topological understanding about system evolution during bifurcations and chaos, such as the changes in the number of subcycles and their positions, lifetimes, and sizes. This paper addresses this research gap by using topological data analysis as a tool to study system evolution and develop a mathematical framework for detecting the topological changes in the underlying system using persistent homology. Using the proposed technique, topological features (e.g., number of relevant k-dimensional holes, etc.) are extracted from nonlinear time series data which are useful for deeper analysis of the system behavior and early detection of bifurcations and chaos. When applied to a Logistic map, a Duffing oscillator, and a real life Op-amp based Jerk circuit, these features are shown to accurately characterize the system dynamics and detect the onset of chaos.

We introduce a methodology that combines topological data analysis with a machine learning technique – k-means clustering – in order to characterize the emerging chaotic regime in a complex system approaching a critical transition. We first test our methodology on the complex system dynamics of a Lorenz-type attractor. Then we apply it to the four major cryptocurrencies.

   abstract = {Finding the correct encoding for a generic dynamical system's trajectory is a complicated task: the symbolic sequence needs to preserve the invariant properties from the system's trajectory. In theory, the solution to this problem is found when a Generating Markov Partition (GMP) is obtained, which is only defined once the unstable and stable manifolds are known with infinite precision and for all times. However, these manifolds usually form highly convoluted Euclidean sets, are a priori unknown, and, as it happens in any real-world experiment, measurements are made with finite resolution and over a finite time-span. The task gets even more complicated if the system is a network composed of interacting dynamical units, namely, a high-dimensional complex system. Here, we tackle this task and solve it by defining a method to approximately construct GMPs for any complex system's finite-resolution and finite-time trajectory. We critically test our method on networks of coupled maps, encoding their trajectories into symbolic sequences. We show that these sequences are optimal because they minimise the information loss and also any spurious information added. Consequently, our method allows us to approximately calculate the invariant probability measures of complex systems from the observed data. Thus, we can efficiently define complexity measures that are applicable to a wide range of complex phenomena, such as the characterisation of brain activity from electroencephalogram signals measured at different brain regions or the characterisation of climate variability from temperature anomalies measured at different Earth regions.},

Here, we develop a model-free method to detect early-warning signals of such critical transitions, even with only a small number of samples. Specifically, we theoretically derive an index based on a dynamical network biomarker (DNB) that serves as a general early-warning signal indicating an imminent bifurcation or sudden deterioration before the critical transition occurs. Based on theoretical analyses, we show that predicting a sudden transition from small samples is achievable provided that there are a large number of measurements for each sample, e.g., high-throughput data. We employ microarray data of three diseases to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

In ice-core proxy records of Greenland paleotemperature, a reduction in the number of climate states from two to one is detected sometime prior to the last glacial maximum (LGM), 23-19 kyr BP.

We test the method on artificial data and then apply it to climate records spanning progressively shorter time periods from 5. 3 Myr ago to the recent observational record. We detect various changes in the number and stability of states in the climate system. The onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation roughly 3 Myr BP is detected as the appearance of a second climate state. During the last ice age in Greenland, there is a bifurcation representing the loss of stability of the warm interstadial state, followed by the total loss of this state around 25 kyr BP. The Holocene is generally characterized by a single stable climate state, especially at large scales. However, in the historical record, at the regional scale, the European monthly temperature anomaly temporarily exhibits a second, highly degenerate (unstable) state during the latter half of the eighteenth century. At the global scale, temperature is currently undergoing a forced movement of a single stable state rather than a bifurcation. The method can be applied to a wide range of geophysical systems with time series of sufficient length and temporal resolution, to look for bifurcations and their precursors. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {It is well known that periodic forcing of a nonlinear system, even of a 2D autonomous system, can produce chaotic responses with sensitive dependence on initial conditions if the forcing induces sufficient stretching and folding of the phase space. Quasiperiodic forcing can similarly produce chaotic responses, where the transition to chaos on changing a parameter can bring the system into regions of strange non-chaotic behaviour. Although it is generally acknowledged that the timings of Pleistocene ice ages are at least partly due to Milankovitch forcing (which may be approximated as quasiperiodic, with energy concentrated near a small number of frequencies), the precise details of what can be inferred about the timings of glaciations and deglaciations from the forcing are still unclear. In this article, we perform a quantitative comparison of the response of several low-order nonlinear conceptual models for these ice ages to various types of quasiperiodic forcing. By computing largest Lyapunov exponents and mean periods, we demonstrate that many models can have a chaotic response to quasiperiodic forcing for a range of forcing amplitudes, even though some of the simplest conceptual models do not. These results suggest that pacing of ice ages to forcing may have only limited determinism.},

   abstract = {Purpose: The specific mechanisms and biomarkersunderlying the progression of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remain unclear. The current study aims to explore novel gene biomarkers associated with CAD progression by analyzing the transcriptomic sequencing data of peripheral blood monocytes in different stages of CAD. Material and Methods: A total of 24 age- and sex- matched patients at different CAD stages who received coronary angiography were enrolled, which included 8 patients with normal coronary angiography, 8 patients with angiographic intermediate lesion, and 8 patients with AMI. The RNA from peripheral blood monocytes was extracted and transcriptome sequenced to analyze the gene expression and the differentially expressed genes (DEG). A Gene Oncology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed to analyze the biological function of genes. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to classify genes into several gene modules with similar expression profiles, and correlation analysis was carried out to explore the association of each gene module with a clinical trait. The dynamic network biomarker (DNB) algorithm was used to calculate the key genes that promote disease progression. Finally, the overlapping genes between different analytic methods were explored. Results: WGCNA analysis identified a total of nine gene modules, of which two modules have the highest positive association with CAD stages. GO enrichment analysis indicated that the biological function of genes in these two gene modules was closely related to inflammatory response, which included T-cell activation, cell response to inflammatory stimuli, lymphocyte activation, cytokine production, and the apoptotic signaling pathway. DNB analysis identified a total of 103 genes that may play key roles in the progression of atherosclerosis plaque. The overlapping genes between DEG/WGCAN and DNB analysis identified the following 13 genes that may play key roles in the progression of atherosclerosis disease: SGPP2, DAZAP2, INSIG1, CD82, OLR1, ARL6IP1, LIMS1, CCL5, CDK7, HBP1, PLAU, SELENOS, and DNAJB6. Conclusions: The current study identified a total of 13 genes that may play key roles in the progression of atherosclerotic plaque and provides new insights for early warning biomarkers and underlying mechanisms underlying the progression of CAD.},

Typical examples are epileptic seizures, changes in the climate system or catastrophic shifts in ecosystems. In order to predict imminent critical transitions, a mathematical apparatus called early warning signals has been developed and this method is used successfully in many scientific areas. However, not all critical transitions can be detected by this approach (false negative) and the appearance of early warning signals does not necessarily proof that a critical transition is imminent (false positive). Furthermore, there are whole classes of systems that always show early warning signals, even though they do not feature critical transitions. In this study we identify such classes in order to provide a safeguard against a misinterpretation of the results of an early warning signal analysis of such systems. Furthermore, we discuss strategies to avoid such systematic false positives and test our theoretical insights by applying them to real world data.},

Here, we show that in relatively simple ecological models the most commonly used early warning signals for a catastrophic collapse can be silent. We underpin the mathematical reason for this phenomenon, which involves the direction of the eigenvectors of the system. Our results demonstrate that claims on the universality of early warning signals are not correct, and that catastrophic collapses can occur without prior warning. In order to correctly predict a collapse and determine whether early warning signals precede the collapse, detailed knowledge of the mathematical structure of the approaching bifurcation is necessary. Unfortunately, such knowledge is often only obtained after the collapse has already occurred. © 2013 Boerlijst et al.},

   abstract = {Tipping points have been actively studied in various applications as well as from a mathematical viewpoint. A main technique to theoretically understand early-warning signs for tipping points is to use the framework of fast-slow stochastic differential equations. A key assumption in many arguments for the existence of variance and auto-correlation growth before a tipping point is to use a linearization argument, i.e. the leading-order term governing the deterministic (or drift) part of a stochastic differential equation is linear. This assumption guarantees a local approximation via an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in the normally hyperbolic regime before, but sufficiently bounded away from, a bifurcation. In this paper, we generalize the situation to leading-order nonlinear terms for the setting of one fast variable. We work in the quasi-steady regime and prove that the fast variable has a well-defined stationary distribution and we calculate the scaling law for the variance as a bifurcation-induced tipping point is approached. We cross-validate the scaling law numerically. Furthermore, we provide a computational study for the predictability using early-warning signs for leading-order nonlinear terms based upon receiver-operator characteristic curves.},

We present here a global approach to identify the minimal perturbation which will instantaneously kick the system out of the basin of attraction of its desired state and hence induce a critical or fatal transition we call shock-tipping. The corresponding Minimal Fatal Shock is a vector whose length can be used as a global stability measure and whose direction in state space allows us to draw conclusions on weaknesses of the network corresponding to critical network motifs. We demonstrate this approach in plant–pollinator networks and the power grid of Great Britain.

As a test bed, six previously analysed datasets are reconsidered, three palaeoclimate records approaching abrupt transitions at the end of the last ice age and three models of varying complexity forced through a collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation. Approaches based on examining the lag-1 autocorrelation function or on detrended fluctuation analysis are applied together and compared. The effects of aggregating the data, detrending method, sliding window length and filtering bandwidth are examined. Robust indicators of critical slowing down are found prior to the abrupt warming event at the end of the Younger Dryas, but the indicators are less clear prior to the Bø lling-Allerød warming, or glacial termination in Antarctica. Early warnings of thermohaline circulation collapse can be masked by interannual variability driven by atmospheric dynamics. However, rapidly decaying modes can be successfully filtered out by using a long bandwidth or by aggregating data. The two methods have complementary strengths and weaknesses and we recommend applying them together to improve the robustness of early warnings.©2012 The Royal Society.},

   abstract = {Despite advances in our mechanistic understanding of ecological processes, the inherent complexity of real-world ecosystems still limits our ability in predicting ecological dynamics especially in the face of on-going environmental stress. Developing a model is frequently challenged by structure uncertainty, unknown parameters, and limited data for exploring out-of-sample predictions. One way to address this challenge is to look for patterns in the data themselves in order to infer the underlying processes of an ecological system rather than to build system-specific models. For example, it has been recently suggested that statistical changes in ecological dynamics can be used to infer changes in the stability of ecosystems as they approach tipping points. For computer scientists such inference is similar to the notion of a Turing machine: a computational device that could execute a program (the process) to produce the observed data (the pattern). Here, we make use of such basic computational ideas introduced by Alan Turing to recognize changing patterns in ecological dynamics in ecosystems under stress. To do this, we use the concept of Kolmogorov algorithmic complexity that is a measure of randomness. In particular, we estimate an approximation to Kolmogorov complexity based on the Block Decomposition Method (BDM). We apply BDM to identify changes in complexity in simulated time-series and spatial datasets from ecosystems that experience different types of ecological transitions. We find that in all cases, KBDM complexity decreased before all ecological transitions both in time-series and spatial datasets. These trends indicate that loss of stability in the ecological models we explored is characterized by loss of complexity and the emergence of a regular and computable underlying structure. Our results suggest that Kolmogorov complexity may serve as tool for revealing changes in the dynamics of ecosystems close to ecological transitions.},

   abstract = {In this study, a new market representation from persistence homology, known as the L1-norm time series, is used and applied independently with three critical slowing down indicators [autocorrelation function at lag 1, variance, and mean for power spectrum (MPS)] to examine two historical financial crises (Dotcom crash and Lehman Brothers bankruptcy) in the US market. The captured signal is the rising trend in the indicator time series, which can be determined by Kendall's tau correlation test. Furthermore, we examined Pearson's and Spearman's rho correlation tests as potential substitutes for Kendall's tau correlation. After that, we determined a correlation threshold and predicted the whole available date. The point of comparison between these correlation tests is to determine which test is significant and consistent in classifying the rising trend. The results of such a comparison will suggest the best test that can classify the observed rising trend and detect early warning signals (EWSs) of impending financial crises. Our outcome shows that the L1-norm time series is more likely to increase before the two financial crises. Kendall's tau, Pearson's, and Spearman's rho correlation tests consistently indicate a significant rising trend in the MPS time series before the two financial crises. Based on the two evaluation scores (the probability of successful anticipation and probability of erroneous anticipation), by using the L1-norm time series with MPS, our result in the whole prediction demonstrated that Spearman's rho correlation (46.15 and 53.85%) obtains the best score as compared to Kendall's tau (42.31 and 57.69%) and Pearson's (40 and 60%) correlations. Therefore, by using Spearman's rho correlation test, L1-norm time series with MPS is shown to be a better way to detect EWSs of US financial crises.},

The method is modified by employing Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) which improves the estimation of short-term decay, especially in climate records which generally possess power-law correlations. When the modified method is applied to GENIE-1 model output that simulates collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, the bifurcation point is correctly anticipated. In Greenland ice core paleotemperature data, for which the conventional degenerate fingerprinting is not applicable due to the short length of the series, the modified method detects the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions. The technique could in principle be used to anticipate future bifurcations in the climate system, but this will require high-resolution time series of the relevant data.

We tested the hypothesis that these statistics would be early warning signals for an experimentally induced regime shift in an aquatic food web. We gradually added top predators to a lake over 3 years to destabilize its food web. An adjacent lake was monitored simultaneously as a reference ecosystem. Warning signals of a regime shift were evident in the manipulated lake during reorganization of the food web more than a year before the food web transition was complete, corroborating theory for leading indicators of ecological regime shifts.},

   abstract = {In pipes, turbulence sets in despite the linear stability of the laminar Hagen-Poiseuille flow. The Reynolds number (Re) for which turbulence first appears in a given experiment - the 'natural transition point' - depends on imperfections of the set-up, or, more precisely, on the magnitude of finite amplitude perturbations. At onset, turbulence typically only occupies a certain fraction of the flow, and this fraction equally is found to differ from experiment to experiment. Despite these findings, Reynolds proposed that after sufficiently long times, flows may settle to steady conditions: below a critical velocity, flows should (regardless of initial conditions) always return to laminar, while above this velocity, eddying motion should persist. As will be shown, even in pipes several thousand diameters long, the spatio-temporal intermittent flow patterns observed at the end of the pipe strongly depend on the initial conditions, and there is no indication that different flow patterns would eventually settle to a (statistical) steady state. Exploiting the fact that turbulent puffs do not age (i.e. they are memoryless), we continuously recreate the puff sequence exiting the pipe at the pipe entrance, and in doing so introduce periodic boundary conditions for the puff pattern. This procedure allows us to study the evolution of the flow patterns for arbitrary long times, and we find that after times in excess of 107 advective time units, indeed a statistical steady state is reached. Although the resulting flows remain spatio-temporally intermittent, puff splitting and decay rates eventually reach a balance, so that the turbulent fraction fluctuates around a well-defined level which only depends on Re. In accordance with Reynolds' proposition, we find that at lower Re (here 2020), flows eventually always resume to laminar, while for higher Re (≥2060), turbulence persists. The critical point for pipe flow hence falls in the interval of 2020 < Re < 2060, which is in very good agreement with the recently proposed value of Rec = 2040. The latter estimate was based on single-puff statistics and entirely neglected puff interactions. Unlike in typical contact processes where such interactions strongly affect the percolation threshold, in pipe flow, the critical point is only marginally influenced. Interactions, on the other hand, are responsible for the approach to the statistical steady state. As shown, they strongly affect the resulting flow patterns, where they cause 'puff clustering', and these regions of large puff densities are observed to travel across the puff pattern in a wave-like fashion.},

At the moderately high Reynolds number, the LES UPO of the present study possesses the spanwise vortices, which seem to be caused by the streak instability and appear in the central region of the channel. We note that to our knowledge a spanwise vortex has not been reported through the UPO analysis of wall flows.

   abstract = {Background: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex disease and harmful to human health, and most of the existing biomarkers are mainly to measure the disease phenotype after the disease onset (or drastic deterioration). Until now, there is no effective biomarker which can predict the upcoming disease (or pre-disease state) before disease onset or disease deterioration. Further, the detail molecular mechanism for such deterioration of the disease, e.g., driver genes or causal network of the disease, is still unclear. Methods. In this study, we detected early-warning signals of T1D and its leading biomolecular networks based on serial gene expression profiles of NOD (non-obese diabetic) mice by identifying a new type of biomarker, i.e., dynamical network biomarker (DNB) which forms a specific module for marking the time period just before the drastic deterioration of T1D. Results: Two dynamical network biomarkers were obtained to signal the emergence of two critical deteriorations for the disease, and could be used to predict the upcoming sudden changes during the disease progression. We found that the two critical transitions led to peri-insulitis and hyperglycemia in NOD mices, which are consistent with other independent experimental results from literature. Conclusions: The identified dynamical network biomarkers can be used to detect the early-warning signals of T1D and predict upcoming disease onset before the drastic deterioration. In addition, we also demonstrated that the leading biomolecular networks are causally related to the initiation and progression of T1D, and provided the biological insight into the molecular mechanism of T1D. Experimental data from literature and functional analysis on DNBs validated the computational results. © 2013 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Synthetic biology and bioengineering provide the opportunity to create novel embodied cognitive systems (otherwise known as minds) in a very wide variety of chimeric architectures combining evolved and designed material and software. These advances are disrupting familiar concepts in the philosophy of mind, and require new ways of thinking about and comparing truly diverse intelligences, whose composition and origin are not like any of the available natural model species. In this Perspective, I introduce TAME—Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere—a framework for understanding and manipulating cognition in unconventional substrates. TAME formalizes a non-binary (continuous), empirically-based approach to strongly embodied agency. TAME provides a natural way to think about animal sentience as an instance of collective intelligence of cell groups, arising from dynamics that manifest in similar ways in numerous other substrates. When applied to regenerating/developmental systems, TAME suggests a perspective on morphogenesis as an example of basal cognition. The deep symmetry between problem-solving in anatomical, physiological, transcriptional, and 3D (traditional behavioral) spaces drives specific hypotheses by which cognitive capacities can increase during evolution. An important medium exploited by evolution for joining active subunits into greater agents is developmental bioelectricity, implemented by pre-neural use of ion channels and gap junctions to scale up cell-level feedback loops into anatomical homeostasis. This architecture of multi-scale competency of biological systems has important implications for plasticity of bodies and minds, greatly potentiating evolvability. Considering classical and recent data from the perspectives of computational science, evolutionary biology, and basal cognition, reveals a rich research program with many implications for cognitive science, evolutionary biology, regenerative medicine, and artificial intelligence.},

Typical examples are epileptic seizures, changes in the climate system or catastrophic shifts in ecosystems. In order to predict imminent critical transitions, a mathematical apparatus called early warning signals has been developed and this method is used successfully in many scientific areas. However, not all critical transitions can be detected by this approach (false negative) and the appearance of early warning signals does not necessarily proof that a critical transition is imminent (false positive). Furthermore, there are whole classes of systems that always show early warning signals, even though they do not feature critical transitions. In this study we identify such classes in order to provide a safeguard against a misinterpretation of the results of an early warning signal analysis of such systems. Furthermore, we discuss strategies to avoid such systematic false positives and test our theoretical insights by applying them to real world data.},

Despite decades of efforts to understand ecosystem dynamics and determine whether a tipping point could occur, there are no current approaches to estimate distances (in state/parameter space) to tipping points and compare the distances across various mutualistic systems. Here we develop a general dimension-reduction approach that simultaneously compresses the natural control and state parameters of high-dimensional complex systems and introduces a scaling factor for recovery rates. Our theoretical framework places various systems with entirely different dynamical parameters, network structure and state perturbations on the same scale. More importantly, it compares distances to tipping points across different systems on the basis of data on abundance and topology. By applying the method to 54 real-world mutualistic networks, our analytical results unveil the network characteristics and system parameters that control a system’s resilience. We contribute to the ongoing efforts in developing a general framework for mapping and predicting distance to tipping points of ecological and potentially other systems.},

However, obtaining warnings of an approaching transition well in advance remains an elusive task. Here we show that a functional network, constructed from spatial correlations of the system's time series, experiences a percolation transition way before the actual system reaches a bifurcation point due to the collective phenomena leading to the global change. Concepts from percolation theory are then used to introduce early warning precursors that anticipate the system's tipping point. We illustrate the generality and versatility of our percolation-based framework with model systems experiencing different types of bifurcations and with Sea Surface Temperature time series associated to El Niño phenomenon.},

   abstract = {Critical transitions of complex systems can often be predicted by so-called early-warning signals (EWS). In some cases, however, such signals cannot be detected although a critical transition is imminent. Observing a relation of EWS-detectability and the network topology in which the system is implemented, we simulate and investigate scale-free networks and identify which networks show, and which do not show EWS in the framework of a two state system that exhibits critical transitions. Additionally, we adapt our approach by examining the effective state of the system, rather than its natural state, and conclude that this transformation can reveal hidden EWS in networks where those signals are otherwise obscured by a complex topology.},

A nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) with coefficients varying in space along propagation is used as a reference model. Based on a low-dimensional approximation obtained by considering only three complex harmonic modes, we discuss how to stabilize a one-dimensional pattern in the form of train of large peaks sitting on a background and propagating over a significant distance. Our approach is based on a gradual depth variation, while its conceptual framework is the theory of autoresonance in nonlinear systems and leads to a quasi-frozen state. Three main stages are identified: amplification from small sideband amplitudes, separatrix crossing and adiabatic conversion to orbits oscillating around an elliptic fixed point. Analytical estimates on the three stages are obtained from the low-dimensional approximation and validated by NLSE simulations. Our result will contribute to understand the dynamical stabilization of nonlinear wave packets and the persistence of large undulatory events in hydrodynamics and other nonlinear dispersive media.},

Such 'non-adiabatic' processes are ubiquitous, but little understood. We identify these processes with a new nonlinear phenomenon-an intricate threshold where a forced system fails to adiabatically follow a changing stable state. In systems with multiple time scales, we derive existence conditions that show such thresholds to be generic, but non-obvious, meaning they cannot be captured by traditional stability theory. Rather, the phenomenon can be analysed using concepts from modern singular perturbation theory: folded singularities and canard trajectories, including composite canards. Thus, nonobvious thresholds should explain the failure to adapt to a changing environment in a wide range of multiscale systems including: tipping points in the climate system, regime shifts in ecosystems, excitability in nerve cells, adaptation failure in regulatory genes and adiabatic switching in technology.},

It is well documented that geometrical focusing can alter the properties of laser filaments and, consequently, a transition between a collimated and a strongly focused filament is expected. Nevertheless, this transition point has not been identified. Here, we propose an analytical method to determine the transition, and show that it corresponds to an actual shift in the balance of physical mechanisms governing filamentation. In high-NA conditions, filamentation is primarily governed by geometrical focusing and plasma effects, while the Kerr nonlinearity plays a more significant role as NA decreases. We find the transition between the two regimes to be relatively insensitive to the intrinsic laser parameters, and our analysis agrees well with a wide range of parameters found in published literature.},

   abstract = {Based on the theory of “snapshot/pullback attractors”, we show that important features of the climate change that we are observing can be understood by imagining many replicas of Earth that are not interacting with each other. Their climate systems evolve in parallel, but not in the same way, although they all obey the same physical laws, in harmony with the chaotic-like nature of the climate dynamics. These parallel climate realizations evolving in time can be considered as members of an ensemble. We argue that the contingency of our Earth’s climate system is characterized by the multiplicity of parallel climate realizations rather than by the variability that we experience in a time series of our observed past. The natural measure of the snapshot attractor enables one to determine averages and other statistical quantifiers of the climate at any instant of time. In this paper, we review the basic idea for climate changes associated with monotonic drifts, and illustrate the large number of possible applications. Examples are given in a low-dimensional model and in numerical climate models of different complexity. We recall that systems undergoing climate change are not ergodic, hence temporal averages are generically not appropriate for the instantaneous characterization of the climate. In particular, teleconnections, i.e. correlated phenomena of remote geographical locations are properly characterized only by correlation coefficients evaluated with respect to the natural measure of a given time instant, and may also change in time. Physics experiments dealing with turbulent-like phenomena in a changing environment are also worth being interpreted in view of the attractor-based ensemble approach. The possibility of the splitting of the snapshot attractor to two branches, near points where the corresponding time-independent system undergoes bifurcation as a function of the changing parameter, is briefly mentioned. This can lead in certain climate-change scenarios to the coexistence of two distinct sub-ensembles representing dramatically different climatic options. The problem of pollutant spreading during climate change is also discussed in the framework of parallel climate realizations.},

   abstract = {The availability of time series of the evolution of the properties of physical systems is increasing, stimulating the development of many novel methods for the extraction of information about their behaviour over time, including whether or not they arise from deterministic or stochastic dynamical systems. Surrogate data testing is an essential part of many of these methods, as it enables robust statistical evaluations to ensure that the results observed are not obtained by chance, but are a true characteristic of the underlying system. The surrogate data technique is based on the comparison of a particular property of the data (a discriminating statistic) with the distribution of the same property calculated in a set of constructed signals (surrogates) which match the original data set but do not possess the property that is being tested. Fourier transform based surrogates remain the most popular, yet many more options have since been developed to test increasingly varied null hypotheses while characterizing the dynamics of complex systems, including uncorrelated and correlated noise, coupling between systems, and synchronization. Here, we provide a detailed overview of a wide range of surrogate types, discuss their practical applications and demonstrate their use in both numerically simulated and real experimental systems. We also compare the performance of various surrogate types for the detection of nonlinearity, synchronization and coherence, coupling strength between systems, and the nature of coupling. A MatLab toolbox for many of the surrogate methods is provided.},

In particular, the ordinal method defines sequences of symbols according to the ordering in which values appear in a time series. This method has been shown to yield useful information, even when applied to signals with large noise contamination. Here, we use ordinal analysis to investigate the transition between eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) resting states. We analyze two electroencephalography datasets (with 71 and 109 healthy subjects) with different recording conditions (sampling rates and the number of electrodes in the scalp). Using as diagnostic tools the permutation entropy, the entropy computed from symbolic transition probabilities, and an asymmetry coefficient (that measures the asymmetry of the likelihood of the transitions between symbols), we show that the ordinal analysis applied to the raw data distinguishes the two brain states. In both datasets, we find that, during the EC-EO transition, the EO state is characterized by higher entropies and lower asymmetry coefficient, as compared to the EC state. Our results thus show that these diagnostic tools have the potential for detecting and characterizing changes in time-evolving brain states.},

   abstract = {Extracting relevant properties of empirical signals generated by nonlinear, stochastic, and high-dimensional systems is a challenge of complex systems research. Open questions are how to differentiate chaotic signals from stochastic ones, and how to quantify nonlinear and/or high-order temporal correlations. Here we propose a new technique to reliably address both problems. Our approach follows two steps: first, we train an artificial neural network (ANN) with flicker (colored) noise to predict the value of the parameter, α, that determines the strength of the correlation of the noise. To predict α the ANN input features are a set of probabilities that are extracted from the time series by using symbolic ordinal analysis. Then, we input to the trained ANN the probabilities extracted from the time series of interest, and analyze the ANN output. We find that the α value returned by the ANN is informative of the temporal correlations present in the time series. To distinguish between stochastic and chaotic signals, we exploit the fact that the difference between the permutation entropy (PE) of a given time series and the PE of flicker noise with the same α parameter is small when the time series is stochastic, but it is large when the time series is chaotic. We validate our technique by analysing synthetic and empirical time series whose nature is well established. We also demonstrate the robustness of our approach with respect to the length of the time series and to the level of noise. We expect that our algorithm, which is freely available, will be very useful to the community.},

   abstract = {Land use change is a principal force and inherent element of global environmental change, threatening biodiversity, natural ecosystems, and their services. However, our ability to anticipate future land use change is severely limited by a lack of understanding of how major socio-economic disturbances (e.g., wars, revolutions, policy changes, and economic crises) affect land use. Here we explored to what extent socio-economic disturbances can shift land use systems onto a different trajectory, and whether this can result in less intensive land use. Our results show that the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused a major reorganization in land use systems. The effects of this socio-economic disturbance were at least as drastic as those of the nuclear disaster in the Chernobyl region in 1986. While the magnitudes of land abandonment were similar in Ukraine and Belarus in the case of the nuclear disaster (28% and 36% of previously farmed land, respectively), the rates of land abandonment after the collapse of the Soviet Union in Ukraine were twice as high as those in Belarus. This highlights that national policies and institutions play an important role in mediating effects of socio-economic disturbances. The socio-economic disturbance that we studied caused major hardship for local populations, yet also presents opportunities for conservation, as natural ecosystems are recovering on large areas of former farmland. Our results illustrate the potential of socio-economic disturbances to revert land use intensification and the important role institutions and policies play in determining land use systems' resilience against such socio-economic disturbances. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {The discussions in the Villefranche Workshop covered a wide range of issues. The term regime shift was originally confined to spatial or temporal correspondences between climatic indices and population abundance. The body of evidence for physical-biological coupling has certainly generated a much better appreciation of the natural decadal scale variability in marine systems. It is difficult, however, to deduce from these time series, the mechanisms or trophic pathways that produce the correspondence. Ideally, we would need experimental manipulations such as those used in small lakes, to unravel the causal connections. Since this is impossible in the open sea, we must use comparisons between systems subject to different types of perturbation or stress. We focused at the Workshop on the effects of over-fishing in different marine regimes. The consequences of large scale changes in community structure imposed by excessive fishing give valuable case studies. Coral reefs, rocky shores, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems provide other examples. The possible existence of similar processes across such diverse systems raises corresponding questions about common ecological principles. The adaptive benefits of maximizing resilience (defined as minimizing the largest eigenvalue of the perturbed system) were considered. The corollary of this assumption is that, at the limits of adaptation, there will be switching between communities, providing a potential ground for a broad definition of regime shifts. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) occurs when time-variation of input parameters of a dynamical system interacts with system timescales to give genuine nonautonomous instabilities. Such instabilities appear as the input varies at some critical rates and cannot, in general, be understood in terms of autonomous bifurcations in the frozen system with a fixed-in-time input. This paper develops an accessible mathematical framework for R-tipping in multidimensional nonautonomous dynamical systems with an autonomous future limit. We focus on R-tipping via loss of tracking of base attractors that are equilibria in the frozen system, due to crossing what we call regular thresholds. These thresholds are associated with regular edge states: compact hyperbolic invariant sets with one unstable direction and orientable stable manifold, that lie on a basin boundary in the frozen system. We define R-tipping and critical rates for the nonautonomous system in terms of special solutions that limit to a compact invariant set of the future limit system that is not an attractor. We focus on the case when the limit set is a regular edge state, which we call the regular R-tipping edge state that anchors the associated regular R-tipping threshold at infinity. We introduce the concept of edge tails to rigorously classify R-tipping into reversible, irreversible, and degenerate cases. The main idea is to compactify the problem and use regular edge states of the future limit system to analyse R-tipping in the nonautonomous system. This allows us to give sufficient conditions for the occurrence of R-tipping in terms of easily testable properties of the frozen system and input variation, and necessary and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of reversible and irreversible R-tipping in terms of computationally verifiable (heteroclinic) connections to regular R-tipping edge states in the compactified system.},

In popular and social scientific discourse, “tipping points” involve abrupt state changes. For some climatic “tipping points,” the commitment to a state change may occur abruptly, but the change itself may be rate-limited and take centuries or longer to realize. Additionally, the connection between climatic “tipping points” and economic losses is tenuous, although emerging empirical and process-model-based tools provide pathways for investigating it. We propose terminology to clarify the distinction between “tipping points” in the popular sense, the critical thresholds exhibited by climatic and social “tipping elements,” and “economic shocks.” The last may be associated with tipping elements, gradual climate change, or nonclimatic triggers. We illustrate our proposed distinctions by surveying the literature on climatic tipping elements, climatically sensitive social tipping elements, and climate–economic shocks, and we propose a research agenda to advance the integrated assessment of all three.},

   abstract = {Many marine ecosystems have undergone ‘regime shifts’, i.e. abrupt reorganizations across trophic levels. Establishing whether these constitute shifts between alternative stable states is of key importance for the prospects of ecosystem recovery and for management.We show how mechanisms underlying alternative stable states caused by predator-prey interactions can be revealed in field data, using analyses guided by theory on size-structured community dynamics. This is done by combining data on individual performance (such as growth and fecundity) with information on population size and prey availability. We use Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and their prey in the Baltic Sea as an example to discuss and distinguish two types of mechanisms, ‘cultivationdepensation’ and ‘overcompensation’, that can cause alternative stable states preventing the recovery of overexploited piscivorous fish populations. Importantly, the type of mechanism can be inferred already from changes in the predators’ body growth in different life stages. Our approach can thus be readily applied to monitored stocks of piscivorous fish species, for which this information often can be assembled. Using this tool can help resolve the causes of catastrophic collapses in marine predatory-prey systems and guide fisheries managers on how to successfully restore collapsed piscivorous fish stocks.},

   abstract = {Understanding marine regime shifts is important not only for ecology but also for developing marine management that assures the provision of ecosystem services to humanity. While regime shift theory is well developed, there is still no common understanding on drivers, mechanisms and characteristic of abrupt changes in real marine ecosystems. Based on contributions to the present theme issue, we highlight some general issues that need to be overcome for developing a more comprehensive understanding of marine ecosystem regime shifts. We find a great divide between benthic reef and pelagic ocean systems in how regime shift theory is linked to observed abrupt changes. Furthermore, we suggest that the long-lasting discussion on the prevalence of top-down trophic or bottom-up physical drivers in inducing regime shifts may be overcome by taking into consideration the synergistic interactions of multiple stressors, and the special characteristics of different ecosystem types. We present a framework for the holistic investigation of marine regime shifts that considers multiple exogenous drivers that interact with endogenous mechanisms to cause abrupt, catastrophic change. This framework takes into account the time-delayed synergies of these stressors, which erode the resilience of the ecosystem and eventually enable the crossing of ecological thresholds. Finally, considering that increased pressures in the marine environment are predicted by the current climate change assessments, in order to avoid major losses of ecosystem services, we suggest that marine management approaches should incorporate knowledge on environmental thresholds and develop tools that consider regime shift dynamics and characteristics. This grand challenge can only be achieved through a holistic view of marine ecosystem dynamics as evidenced by this theme issue.},

   abstract = {In 1993, six Canadian populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) had collapsed to the point where a moratorium was declared on fishing. It has been argued that the collapses were caused by poor recruitment of cod to the fishery. Yet we are unable to detect a difference between the recruitment of year classes that should have contributed most to the spawning stock at the time of the collapse and recruitment levels in earlier years. A power analysis shows that we would have almost certainly detected an overall reduction of recruitment of 20%. There are considerable differences in the abundance trends as determined by research surveys and reconstructed from the commercial catch at age data (called 'virtual population analysis' [VPA]) for each stock. VPA-based abundances consistently depict lower recruitment levels than do survey-based estimates in recent years. More important is the observation that from the early 1980s the VPA-based trend shows a decline where none is apparent in the survey-based trend. One explanation of these differences would be an increase in discarding of young fish as fishing mortality increased. We test the hypothesis that the mortality for young cod is unrelated to the fully recruited fishing mortality. This hypothesis is rejected; in each of the six stocks, high juvenile mortality was associated with high adult mortality. This is consistent with the discarding hypothesis. We suggest that age-specific abundance trends estimated from research surveys and VPA should be compared for all stocks where such data exist, and that high priority should be given to the measurement of discarding levels and the extent to which catch misreporting is related to changes in fishing mortality.},

   abstract = {Land use change is a principal force and inherent element of global environmental change, threatening biodiversity, natural ecosystems, and their services. However, our ability to anticipate future land use change is severely limited by a lack of understanding of how major socio-economic disturbances (e.g., wars, revolutions, policy changes, and economic crises) affect land use. Here we explored to what extent socio-economic disturbances can shift land use systems onto a different trajectory, and whether this can result in less intensive land use. Our results show that the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused a major reorganization in land use systems. The effects of this socio-economic disturbance were at least as drastic as those of the nuclear disaster in the Chernobyl region in 1986. While the magnitudes of land abandonment were similar in Ukraine and Belarus in the case of the nuclear disaster (28% and 36% of previously farmed land, respectively), the rates of land abandonment after the collapse of the Soviet Union in Ukraine were twice as high as those in Belarus. This highlights that national policies and institutions play an important role in mediating effects of socio-economic disturbances. The socio-economic disturbance that we studied caused major hardship for local populations, yet also presents opportunities for conservation, as natural ecosystems are recovering on large areas of former farmland. Our results illustrate the potential of socio-economic disturbances to revert land use intensification and the important role institutions and policies play in determining land use systems' resilience against such socio-economic disturbances. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {During the decline to extinction, animal populations may present dynamical phenomena not exhibited by robust populations1,2. Some of these phenomena, such as the scaling of demographic variance, are related to small size3-6 whereas others result from density-dependent nonlinearities7. Although understanding the causes of population extinction has been a central problem in theoretical biology for decades8, the ability to anticipate extinction has remained elusive9. Here we argue that the causes of a population's decline are central to the predictability of its extinction. Specifically, environmental degradation may cause a tipping point in population dynamics, corresponding to a bifurcation in the underlying population growth equations, beyond which decline to extinction is almost certain. In such cases, imminent extinction will be signalled by critical slowing down (CSD). We conducted an experiment with replicate laboratory populations of Daphnia magna to test this hypothesis. We show that populations crossing a transcritical bifurcation, experimentally induced by the controlled decline in environmental conditions, show statistical signatures of CSD after the onset of environmental deterioration and before the critical transition. Populations in constant environments did not have these patterns. Four statistical indicators all showed evidence of the approaching bifurcation as early as 110 days (∼8 generations) before the transition occurred. Two composite indices improved predictability, and comparative analysis showed that early warning signals based solely on observations in deteriorating environments without reference populations for standardization were hampered by the presence of transient dynamics before the onset of deterioration, pointing to the importance of reliable baseline data before environmental deterioration begins. The universality of bifurcations in models of population dynamics suggests that this phenomenon should be general10-12. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

This stylized fact has been supported by a vast collection of empirical studies. Given that the conventional measures of skewness and kurtosis are computed as an average and that averages are not robust, we ask: "How useful are the measures of skewness and kurtosis used in previous empirical studies?" To answer this question, we provide a survey of robust measures of skewness and kurtosis from the statistics literature and carry out extensive Monte Carlo simulations that compare the conventional measures with the robust measures of our survey. An application of the robust measures to daily S&P500 index data indicates that the stylized facts might have been accepted too readily.

   abstract = {Many natural systems exhibit tipping points where slowly changing environmental conditions spark a sudden shift to a new and sometimes very different state. As the tipping point is approached, the dynamics of complex and varied systems simplify down to a limited number of possible "normal forms" that determine qualitative aspects of the new state that lies beyond the tipping point, such as whether it will oscillate or be stable. In several of those forms, indicators like increasing lag-1 autocorrelation and variance provide generic early warning signals (EWS) of the tipping point by detecting how dynamics slow down near the transition. But they do not predict the nature of the new state. Here we develop a deep learning algorithm that provides EWS in systems it was not explicitly trained on, by exploiting information about normal forms and scaling behavior of dynamics near tipping points that are common to many dynamical systems. The algorithm provides EWS in 268 empirical and model time series from ecology, thermoacoustics, climatology, and epidemiology with much greater sensitivity and specificity than generic EWS. It can also predict the normal form that characterizes the oncoming tipping point, thus providing qualitative information on certain aspects of the new state. Such approaches can help humans better prepare for, or avoid, undesirable state transitions. The algorithm also illustrates how a universe of possible models can be mined to recognize naturally occurring tipping points.},

   abstract = {The Quaternary period has been characterised by a cyclical series of glaciations, which are attributed to the change in the insolation (incoming solar radiation) from changes in the Earth’s orbit around the Sun. The spectral power in the climate record is very different from that of the orbital forcing: prior to 1000 kyr before present most of the spectral power is in the 41 kyr band while since then the power has been in the 100 kyr band. The change defines the middle Pleistocene transition (MPT). The MPT does not indicate any noticeable difference in the orbital forcing. The climate response to the insolation is thus far from linear, and appears to be structurally different before and after the MPT. This paper presents a low order conceptual model for the oscillatory dynamics of the ice sheets in terms of a relaxation oscillator with multiple levels subject to the Milankovitch forcing. The model exhibits smooth transitions between three different climate states; an interglacial (i), a mild glacial (g) and a deep glacial (G) as proposed by Paillard (Nature 391:378–381, 1998). The model suggests a dynamical explanation in terms of the structure of a slow manifold for the observed allowed and “forbidden” transitions between the three climate states. With the model, the pacing of the climate oscillations by the astronomical forcing is through the mechanism of phase-resetting of relaxation oscillations in which the internal phase of the oscillation is affected by the forcing. In spite of its simplicity as a forced ODE, the model is able to reproduce not only general features but also many of the details of oscillations observed in the climate record. A particular novelty is that it includes a slow drift in the form of the slow manifold that reproduces the observed dynamical change at the MPT. We explain this change in terms of a transcritical bifurcation in the fast dynamics on varying the slow variable; this bifurcation can induce a sudden change in periodicity and amplitude of the cycle and we suggest that this is associated with a branch of “canard oscillations” that appear for a small range of parameters. The model is remarkably robust at simulating the climate record before, during and after the MPT. Even though the conceptual model does not point to specific mechanisms, the physical implication is that the major reorganisation of the climate response to the orbital forcing does not necessarily imply that there was a big change in the environmental conditions.},

   abstract = {Catastrophic regime shifts in complex natural systems may be averted through advanced detection. Recent work has provided a proof-of-principle that many systems approaching a catastrophic transition may be identified through the lens of early warning indicators such as rising variance or increased return times. Despite widespread appreciation of the difficulties and uncertainty involved in such forecasts, proposed methods hardly ever characterize their expected error rates. Without the benefits of replicates, controls or hindsight, applications of these approaches must quantify how reliable different indicators are in avoiding false alarms, and how sensitive they are to missing subtle warning signs. We propose a model-based approach to quantify this trade-off between reliability and sensitivity and allow comparisons between different indicators. We show these error rates can be quite severe for common indicators even under favourable assumptions, and also illustrate how a model-based indicator can improve this performance. We demonstrate how the performance of an early warning indicator varies in different datasets, and suggest that uncertainty quantification become a more central part of early warning predictions. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

Superimposed on these long glacial cycles comes an intricate pattern of millennial and sub-millennial variability, including Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich events. There are numerous theories about these oscillations. Here, we review a number of them in order to draw a parallel between climatic concepts and dynamical system concepts, including, in particular, the relaxation oscillator, excitability, slow-fast dynamics and homoclinic orbits. Namely, almost all theories of ice ages reviewed here feature a phenomenon of synchronization between internal climate dynamics and astronomical forcing. However, these theories differ in their bifurcation structure and this has an effect on the way the ice age phenomenon could grow 3 Ma ago. All theories on rapid events reviewed here rely on the concept of a limit cycle excited by changes in the surface freshwater balance of the ocean. The article also reviews basic effects of stochastic fluctuations on these models, including the phenomenon of phase dispersion, shortening of the limit cycle and stochastic resonance. It concludes with a more personal statement about the potential for inference with simple stochastic dynamical systems in palaeoclimate science. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

   abstract = {Early warning signals have been proposed to forecast the possibility of a critical transition, such as the eutrophication of a lake, the collapse of a coral reef or the end of a glacial period. Because such transitions often unfold on temporal and spatial scales that can be difficult to approach by experimental manipulation, research has often relied on historical observations as a source of natural experiments. Here, we examine a critical difference between selecting systems for study based on the fact that we have observed a critical transition and those systems for which we wish to forecast the approach of a transition. This difference arises by conditionally selecting systems known to experience a transition of some sort and failing to account for the bias this introduces-a statistical error often known as the prosecutor's fallacy. By analysing simulated systems that have experienced transitions purely by chance, we reveal an elevated rate of false-positives in common warning signal statistics. We further demonstrate a model-based approach that is less subject to this bias than those more commonly used summary statistics. We note that experimental studies with replicates avoid this pitfall entirely. © The Royal Society 2012.},

   abstract = {The realization that complex systems such as ecological communities can collapse or shift regimes suddenly and without rapid external forcing poses a serious challenge to our understanding and management of the natural world. The potential to identify early warning signals that would allow researchers and managers to predict such events before they happen has therefore been an invaluable discovery that offers a way forward in spite of such seemingly unpredictable behavior. Research into early warning signals has demonstrated that it is possible to define and detect such early warning signals in advance of a transition in certain contexts. Here, we describe the pattern emerging as research continues to explore just how far we can generalize these results. A core of examples emerges that shares three properties: the phenomenon of rapid regime shifts, a pattern of "critical slowing down" that can be used to detect the approaching shift, and a mechanism of bifurcation driving the sudden change. As research has expanded beyond these core examples, it is becoming clear that not all systems that show regime shifts exhibit critical slowing down, or vice versa. Even when systems exhibit critical slowing down, statistical detection is a challenge. We review the literature that explores these edge cases and highlight the need for (a) new early warning behaviors that can be used in cases where rapid shifts do not exhibit critical slowing down; (b) the development of methods to identify which behavior might be an appropriate signal when encountering a novel system, bearing in mind that a positive indication for some systems is a negative indication in others; and (c) statistical methods that can distinguish between signatures of early warning behaviors and noise. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

   abstract = {The growth and reduction of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets over the past million years is dominated by an approximately 100,000-year periodicity and a sawtooth pattern (gradual growth and fast termination). Milankovitch theory proposes that summer insolation at high northern latitudes drives the glacial cycles, and statistical tests have demonstrated that the glacial cycles are indeed linked to eccentricity, obliquity and precession cycles. Yet insolation alone cannot explain the strong 100,000-year cycle, suggesting that internal climatic feedbacks may also be at work. Earlier conceptual models, for example, showed that glacial terminations are associated with the build-up of Northern Hemisphere 'excess ice', but the physical mechanisms underpinning the 100,000-year cycle remain unclear. Here we show, using comprehensive climate and ice-sheet models, that insolation and internal feedbacks between the climate, the ice sheets and the lithosphere-asthenosphere system explain the 100,000-year periodicity. The responses of equilibrium states of ice sheets to summer insolation show hysteresis, with the shape and position of the hysteresis loop playing a key part in determining the periodicities of glacial cycles. The hysteresis loop of the North American ice sheet is such that after inception of the ice sheet, its mass balance remains mostly positive through several precession cycles, whose amplitudes decrease towards an eccentricity minimum. The larger the ice sheet grows and extends towards lower latitudes, the smaller is the insolation required to make the mass balance negative. Therefore, once a large ice sheet is established, a moderate increase in insolation is sufficient to trigger a negative mass balance, leading to an almost complete retreat of the ice sheet within several thousand years. This fast retreat is governed mainly by rapid ablation due to the lowered surface elevation resulting from delayed isostatic rebound, which is the lithosphere-asthenosphere response. Carbon dioxide is involved, but is not determinative, in the evolution of the 100,000-year glacial cycles. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {In the study of Boettiger & Hastings [1], we demonstrated that conditioning on observing a purely stochastic transition from one stable basin to another could generate time-series trajectories that could be mistaken for an early warning signal of a critical transition (such as might be due to a fold bifur-cation [2]), when instead the shift is merely due to chance. While the goal was to highlight a potential danger in mining historical records for patterns showing sudden shifts when seeking to test early warning techniques, Drake [3] draws attention to a potentially more interesting consequence of our analysis. Drake argues that the bias observed could be used to forecast purely stochastic transitions-a task previously thought to be impossible [4]. We feel this interpretation is too generous. The pattern Drake points to arises in any large deviation, regardless of whether a system is or is not at elevated risk for a transition. We illustrate this pattern in systems with and without bistability, demonstrating that early warning signals do not exist for purely stochastic transitions. Here, we provide a numerical demonstration that the pattern in question for consideration of an early warning signal appears not only before purely sto-chastic transitions (as seen in [1]) but also during any large deviation. As large deviations can occur even in stochastic systems that have only a single stable point, these patterns cannot be considered indicators of stochastic transitions. We demonstrate this in two scenarios: first using the Allee model of alternative stable states considered in [1], (eqn 2.1-2.2 and fig. 2), and then in a simple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model, which has only a single stable state. Rather than condition on a stochastic transition having occurred (as in [1]), we now condition on having merely observed a sufficiently large deviation (larger deviations will be rarer and show a more pronounced pattern). We pick values such that we obtain a sample of a few hundred large deviation events in a sample of 20 000 replicates. The OU model is defined by a stochastic differential equation in which there is only a single optimum whose strength is proportional to the displacement, dX t ¼ ÀaX t dt þ sdB t ; where the state X t oscillates around a stable point (at zero in these arbitrary units), driven by Brownian noise dB t of intensity s and restorative force a. The analysis for each model proceeds exactly as in [1]: for each model, we generate 20 000 replicate time series. We condition upon only those experiencing a deviation of size L (X 250 in the Allee model and X 24 in the OU model). For the sequence of observations immediately leading up to the large deviation, we compute the warning signals of variance and autocorrelation over a sliding window of half the length of the time series, and we summarize the increasing or the decreasing trend observed in the variance and autocorrelation using Kendall's t rank correlation coefficient (all following the method for early},

Here we develop a novel detection method, using simple theoretical models to train a deep neural network to detect critical transitions - the Early Warning Signal Network (EWSNet). We then demonstrate that this network, trained on simulated data, can reliably predict observed real-world transitions in systems ranging from rapid climatic change to the collapse of ecological populations. Importantly, our model appears to capture latent properties in time series missed by previous warning signals approaches, allowing us to not only detect if a transition is approaching, but critically whether the collapse will be catastrophic or non-catastrophic. These novel properties mean EWSNet has the potential to serve as an indicator of transitions across a broad spectrum of complex systems, without requiring information on the structure of the system being monitored. Our work highlights the practicality of deep learning for addressing further questions pertaining to ecosystem collapse and has much broader management implications.},

   abstract = {Palaeorecords suggest that the climate system has tipping points, where small changes in forcing cause substantial and irreversible alteration to Earth system components called tipping elements. As atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise as a result of fossil fuel burning, human activity could also trigger tipping, and the impacts would be difficult to adapt to. Previous studies report low global warming thresholds above pre-industrial conditions for key tipping elements such as ice-sheet melt. If so, high contemporary rates of warming imply that exceeding these thresholds is almost inevitable, which is widely assumed to mean that we are now committed to suffering these tipping events. Here we show that this assumption may be flawed, especially for slow-onset tipping elements (such as the collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) in our rapidly changing climate. Recently developed theory indicates that a threshold may be temporarily exceeded without prompting a change of system state, if the overshoot time is short compared to the effective timescale of the tipping element. To demonstrate this, we consider transparently simple models of tipping elements with prescribed thresholds, driven by global warming trajectories that peak before returning to stabilize at a global warming level of 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level. These results highlight the importance of accounting for timescales when assessing risks associated with overshooting tipping point thresholds.},

   abstract = {Early warning signals (EWS) are statistical indicators that a rapid regime shift may be forthcoming. Their development has given ecologists hope of predicting rapid regime shifts before they occur. Accurate predictions, however, rely on the signals being appropriate to the system in question. Most of the EWS commonly applied in ecology have been studied in the context of one specific type of regime shift (the type brought on by a saddle-node bifurcation, at which one stable equilibrium point collides with an unstable equilibrium and disappears) under one particular perturbation scheme (temporally uncorrelated noise that perturbs the net population growth rate in a density independent way). Whether and when these EWS can be applied to other ecological situations remains relatively unknown, and certainly underappreciated. We study a range of models with different types of dynamical transitions (including rapid regime shifts) and several perturbation schemes (density-dependent uncorrelated or temporally-correlated noise) and test the ability of EWS to warn of an approaching transition. We also test the sensitivity of our results to the amount of available pre-transition data and various decisions that must be made in the analysis (i.e. the rolling window size and smoothing bandwidth used to compute the EWS). We find that EWS generally work well to signal an impending saddle-node bifurcation, regardless of the autocorrelation or intensity of the noise. However, EWS do not reliably appear as expected for other types of transition. EWS were often very sensitive to the length of the pre-transition time series analyzed, and usually less sensitive to other decisions. We conclude that the EWS perform well for saddle-node bifurcation in a range of noise environments, but different methods should be used to predict other types of regime shifts. As a consequence, knowledge of the mechanism behind a possible regime shift is needed before EWS can be used to predict it.},

   abstract = {In the vicinity of a tipping point, critical transitions occur when small changes in an input condition cause sudden, large, and often irreversible changes in the state of a system. Many natural systems ranging from ecosystems to molecular biosystems are known to exhibit critical transitions in their response to stochastic perturbations. In diseases, an early prediction of upcoming critical transitions from a healthy to a disease state by using early-warning signals is of prime interest due to potential application in forecasting disease onset. Here, we analyze cell-fate transitions between different phenotypes (epithelial, hybridepithelial/ mesenchymal [E/M], and mesenchymal states) that are implicated in cancer metastasis and chemoresistance. These transitions are mediated by a mutually inhibitory feedback loop- microRNA-200/ZEB-driven by the levels of transcription factor SNAIL. We find that the proximity to tipping points enabling these transitions among different phenotypes can be captured by critical slowing down-based early-warning signals, calculated from the trajectory of ZEB messenger RNA level. Further, the basin stability analysis reveals the unexpectedly large basin of attraction for a hybrid-E/M phenotype. Finally, we identified mechanisms that can potentially elude the transition to a hybrid- E/M phenotype. Overall, our results unravel the early-warning signals that can be used to anticipate upcoming epithelial-hybridmesenchymal transitions. With the emerging evidence about the hybrid-E/M phenotype being a key driver of metastasis, drug resistance, and tumor relapse, our results suggest ways to potentially evade these transitions, reducing the fitness of cancer cells and restricting tumor aggressiveness.},

Superimposed on these long glacial cycles comes an intricate pattern of millennial and sub-millennial variability, including Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich events. There are numerous theories about these oscillations. Here, we review a number of them in order to draw a parallel between climatic concepts and dynamical system concepts, including, in particular, the relaxation oscillator, excitability, slow-fast dynamics and homoclinic orbits. Namely, almost all theories of ice ages reviewed here feature a phenomenon of synchronization between internal climate dynamics and astronomical forcing. However, these theories differ in their bifurcation structure and this has an effect on the way the ice age phenomenon could grow 3 Ma ago. All theories on rapid events reviewed here rely on the concept of a limit cycle excited by changes in the surface freshwater balance of the ocean. The article also reviews basic effects of stochastic fluctuations on these models, including the phenomenon of phase dispersion, shortening of the limit cycle and stochastic resonance.

   abstract = {There is currently much interest in examining climatic tipping points, to see if it is feasible to predict them in advance. Using techniques from bifurcation theory, recent work looks for a slowing down of the intrinsic transient responses, which is predicted to occur before an instability is encountered. This is done, for example, by determining the short-term autocorrelation coefficient ARC(1) in a sliding window of the time-series: this stability coefficient should increase to unity at tipping. Such studies have been made both on climatic computer models and on real paleoclimate data preceding ancient tipping events. The latter employ reconstituted time-series provided by ice cores, sediments, etc., and seek to establish whether the actual tipping could have been accurately predicted in advance. One such example is the end of the Younger Dryas event, about 11 500 years ago, when the Arctic warmed by 7°C in 50 yrs. A second gives an excellent prediction for the end of "greenhouse" Earth about 34 million years ago when the climate tipped from a tropical state into an icehouse state, using data from tropical Pacific sediment cores. This prediction science is very young, but some encouraging results are already being obtained.

Both ε and δ are small parameters. This problem is motivated by laser experiments as well as theoretical studies of laser problems. In addition, this equation is a typical amplitude equation for imperfect steady bifurcations with cubic nonlinearities. When δ=0, we have found that λ=0 is not the point where the bifurcation transition is observed. This transition appears at a value λ =λj > 0. We call λj the delay of the bifurcation transition. We study this delay as a function of λi, the initial position of λ, and δ, the imperfection parameter. To this end, we propose an asymptotic study of this equation as δ → 0, ε small but fixed. Our main objective is to describe this delay in terms of the relative magnitude of δ and ε.

The delayed bifurcation means that the bifurcation does not happen immediately at the bifurcation point as the bifurcation parameter passes through some bifurcation point, but at some other point which is above the bifurcation point by an obvious distance. In a time-delayed system, the evolution of the system depends not only on the present state but also on past states. In this paper, the time-delayed slow-fast system is firstly simplified to a slow-fast system without time delay by means of the center manifold reduction, and then the so-called entry-exit function is defined to characterize the delayed bifurcation on the basis of Neishtadt's theory. It shows that delayed Hopf bifurcation exists in time-delayed slow-fast systems, and the theoretical prediction on the exit-point is in good agreement with the numerical calculation, as illustrated in the two illustrative examples. © 2010 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Higher-order N-soliton solutions with N=2, 3 are studied in detail and shown to be associated with self-focusing in the wave group dynamics and the generation of a steep localized carrier wave underneath the group envelope. We also show that for larger input soliton numbers, the wave group experiences irreversible spectral broadening, which we refer to as a hydrodynamic supercontinuum by analogy with optics. This process is shown to be associated with the fission of the initial multisoliton into individual fundamental solitons due to higher-order nonlinear perturbations to the NLS. Numerical simulations using an extended NLS model described by the modified nonlinear Schrödinger equation, show excellent agreement with experiment and highlight the universal role that higher-order nonlinear perturbations to the NLS play in supercontinuum generation. © 2013 American Physical Society.},

It is found, to the lowest order of perturbation, that the complicated system of equations governing such modulation can be reduced to a simple nonlinear Schrödinger equation. A nonlinear plane wave solution to this equation is found to correspond to the so-called Stokes wave. The linear stability of this plane wave solution is essentially determined by the sign of the product of two coefficients in this equation, yielding Benjamin and Whitham's criterion.

   abstract = {During its periodic motion, a particle floating at the free surface of a water wave experiences a net drift velocity in the direction of wave propagation, known as the Stokes drift (Stokes 1847 Trans. Camb. Philos. Soc. 8, 441–455). More generally, the Stokes drift velocity is the difference between the average Lagrangian flow velocity of a fluid parcel and the average Eulerian flow velocity of the fluid. This paper reviews progress in fundamental and applied research on the induced mean flow associated with surface gravity waves since the first description of the Stokes drift, now 170 years ago. After briefly reviewing the fundamental physical processes, most of which have been established for decades, the review addresses progress in laboratory and field observations of the Stokes drift. Despite more than a century of experimental studies, laboratory studies of the mean circulation set up by waves in a laboratory flume remain somewhat contentious. In the field, rapid advances are expected due to increasingly small and cheap sensors and transmitters, making widespread use of small surface-following drifters possible. We also discuss remote sensing of the Stokes drift from high-frequency radar. Finally, the paper discusses the three main areas of application of the Stokes drift: in the coastal zone, in Eulerian models of the upper ocean layer and in the modelling of tracer transport, such as oil and plastic pollution. Future climate models will probably involve full coupling of ocean and atmosphere systems, in which the wave model provides consistent forcing on the ocean surface boundary layer. Together with the advent of new space-borne instruments that can measure surface Stokes drift, such models hold the promise of quantifying the impact of wave effects on the global atmosphere–ocean system and hopefully contribute to improved climate projections.

   abstract = {We discuss the nonlinear phenomena of irreversible tipping for non-autonomous systems where time-varying inputs correspond to a smooth 'parameter shift' from one asymptotic value to another. We express tipping in terms of properties of local pullback attractors and present some results on how nontrivial dynamics for non-autonomous systems can be deduced from analysis of the bifurcation diagram for an associated autonomous system where parameters are fixed. In particular, we show that there is a unique local pullback point attractor associated with each linearly stable equilibrium for the past limit. If there is a smooth stable branch of equilibria over the range of values of the parameter shift, the pullback attractor will remain close to (track) this branch for small enough rates, though larger rates may lead to rate-induced tipping. More generally, we show that one can track certain stable paths that go along several stable branches by pseudo-orbits of the system, for small enough rates. For these local pullback point attractors, we define notions of bifurcation-induced and irreversible rate-induced tipping of the non-autonomous system. In one-dimension, we introduce the notion of forward basin stability and use this to give a number of sufficient conditions for the presence or absence of rate-induced tipping. We apply our results to give criteria for irreversible rate-induced tipping in a conceptual climate model.},

   abstract = {Regime shifts are massive, often irreversible, rearrangements of nonlinear ecological processes that occur when systems pass critical transition points. Ecological regime shifts sometimes have severe consequences for human well-being, including eutrophication in lakes, desertification, and species extinctions. Theoretical and laboratory evidence suggests that statistical anomalies may be detectable leading indicators of regime shifts in ecological time series, making it possible to foresee and potentially avert incipient regime shifts. Conditional heteroscedasticity is persistent variance characteristic of time series with clustered volatility. Here, we analyze conditional heteroscedasticity as a potential leading indicator of regime shifts in ecological time series. We evaluate conditional heteroscedasticity by using ecological models with and without four types of critical transition. On approaching transition points, all time series contain significant conditional heteroscedasticity. This signal is detected hundreds of time steps in advance of the regime shift. Time series without regime shifts do not have significant conditional heteroscedasticity. Because probability values are easily associated with tests for conditional heteroscedasticity, detection of false positives in time series without regime shifts is minimized. This property reduces the need for a reference system to compare with the perturbed system. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.},

   abstract = {Regular vegetation patterns have been predicted to indicate a system slowing down and possibly desertification of drylands. However, these predictions have not yet been observed in dryland vegetation due to the inherent logistic difficulty to gather longer-term in situ data. Here, we evaluate the theoretical prediction that regular vegetation patterns are associated with empirically derived temporal indicators (autocorrelation, variance, responsiveness) of critical slowing down in a dryland ecosystem in Sudan using different remote sensing products. We use recently developed methods using remote-sensing EVI time-series in combination with classified regular vegetation patterns along a rainfall gradient in Sudan to test the predicted slowing down. We tested our empirical findings against theoretical predictions from a stochastic version of a spatial explicit model that has been used to describe vegetation dynamics in drylands under aridity stress. Overall, three temporal indicators (responsiveness, temporal autocorrelation, variance) show slowing down as vegetation patterns change from gaps to labyrinths to spots towards more arid conditions, confirming predictions. However, this transition exhibits non-linearities, specifically when patterns change configuration. Model simulations reveal that the transition between patterns temporarily slows down the system affecting the temporal indicators. These transient states when vegetation patterns reorganize thus affect the systems resilience indicators in a non-linear way. Our findings suggest that spatial self-organization of dryland vegetation is associated with critical slowing down, but this transition towards reduced resilience happens in a non-linear way. Future work should aim to better understand transient dynamics in regular vegetation patterns in dryland ecosystems, because long transients make regular vegetation patterns of limited use for management in anticipating critical transitions.},

   abstract = {As the recent COVID-19 pandemic has shown us, there is a critical need to develop new approaches to monitoring the outbreak and spread of infectious disease. Improvements in monitoring will enable a timely implementation of control measures, including vaccine and quarantine, to stem the spread of disease. One such approach involves the use of early warning signals to detect when critical transitions are about to occur. Although the early detection of a stochastic transition is difficult to predict using the generic indicators of early warning signals theory, the changes detected by the indicators do tell us that some type of transition is taking place. This observation will serve as the foundation of the method described in the article. We consider a susceptible–infectious–susceptible epidemic model with reproduction number R> 1 so that the deterministic endemic equilibrium is stable. Stochastically, realizations will fluctuate around this equilibrium for a very long time until, as a rare event, the noise will induce a transition from the endemic state to the extinct state. In this article, we describe how metric-based indicators from early warning signals theory can be used to monitor the state of the system. By measuring the autocorrelation, return rate, skewness, and variance of the time series, it is possible to determine when the system is in a weakened state. By applying a control that emulates vaccine/quarantine when the system is in this weakened state, we can cause the disease to go extinct earlier than it otherwise would without control. We also demonstrate that applying a control at the wrong time (when the system is in a non-weakened, highly resilient state) can lead to a longer extinction time than if no control had been applied. This feature underlines the importance of determining the system’s state of resilience before attempting to affect its behavior through control measures.},

Specifically, we study (possibly noninvertible) maps with a time-varying parameter subject to a parameter shift. We show that each stable path has a unique associated solution (a local pullback attractor) which stays near the path for all negative time. When the parameter changes slowly, this local pullback attractor stays near the path for all time, but if the parameter changes quickly, the local pullback attractor may move away from the path in positive time; this is the phenomenon of R-tipping. We demonstrate that forward basin stability is an insufficient condition to prevent R-tipping in maps of any dimension but that forward inflowing stability is sufficient. Furthermore, we show that R-tipping will happen when there is a certain kind of forward basin instability, and we prove precisely what happens to the local pullback attractor as the rate of the parameter change approaches infinity. We then highlight the differences between discrete- and continuous-time systems by showing that when a map is obtained by discretizing a flow, the pullback attractors for the map and flow can have dramatically different behavior; there may be R-tipping in one system but not in the other. We finish by applying our results to demonstrate R-tipping in the 2-dimensional Ikeda map.},

   abstract = {Tipping points describe bifurcations where the output of a dynamical system changes disproportionately compared to the change in the parameter. A classification of different mechanism of tipping in dynamical systems has been proposed in literature and a new behaviour has been identified: the so-called rate-induced tipping, R-tipping or rate-induced bifurcation. This work aims at providing a mathematical framework for rate-induced tipping in one dimensional nonautonomous dynamical systems in the presence of bounded noise and to give a necessary condition for such behaviour to occur. It is given an autonomous dynamical system depending on a parameter. The system is generally not undergoing any classical bifurcation under changes in the parameter. We consider the parameter changing in time at a positive rate so that the system is now nonautonomous but asymptotically autonomous. Moreover, consider a bounded time-dependent perturbation so that the system can be regarded as a nonautonomous set-valued (or general) dynamical system. A rate-induced tipping describes a destabilisation of such system due to a rapid change in the parameter, i.e. the existence of a critical rate. A precise definition of rate-induced tipping as a discontinuity in the limiting behaviour of a local pullback attractor is proposed. Under appropriate assumptions, an attractor-repeller collision is shown to be a necessary condition for such tipping to occur.},

   abstract = {The climate is a forced, dissipative, nonlinear, complex, and heterogeneous system that is out of thermodynamic equilibrium. The system exhibits natural variability on many scales of motion, in time as well as space, and it is subject to various external forcings, natural as well as anthropogenic. This review covers the observational evidence on climate phenomena and the governing equations of planetary-scale flow and presents the key concept of a hierarchy of models for use in the climate sciences. Recent advances in the application of dynamical systems theory, on the one hand, and nonequilibrium statistical physics, on the other hand, are brought together for the first time and shown to complement each other in helping understand and predict the system's behavior. These complementary points of view permit a self-consistent handling of subgrid-scale phenomena as stochastic processes, as well as a unified handling of natural climate variability and forced climate change, along with a treatment of the crucial issues of climate sensitivity, response, and predictability.},

In this region, waves of surprisingly large size, alternatively called freak, rogue, or giant waves are produced. We show how this mechanism produces freak waves at random locations when ocean swell traverses an area of random current. When the current has a constant (possibly zero) mean with small random fluctuations, we show that the probability distribution for the formation of a freak wave is universal, that is, it does not depend on the statistics of the current, but only on a single distance scale parameter, provided that this parameter is finite and non-xero. Our numerical simulations show excellent agreement with the theory, even for current standard deviation as large as 1.0 m s-1. Since many of these results are derived for arbitrary dispersion relations with certain general properties, they include as a special case previously published work on caustics in geometrical optics.},

These dragon-kings reveal the existence of mechanisms of self-organization that are not apparent otherwise from the distribution of their smaller siblings. A generic phase diagram is presented to explain the generation of dragon-kings. The presence of dragon-kings is documented and assessed in six different examples (distribution of city sizes, distribution of acoustic emissions associated with material failure, distribution of velocity increments in hydrodynamic turbulence, distribution of financial drawdowns, distribution of the energies of epileptic seizures in humans and in model animals, distribution of earthquake energies). Dragon-kings are often associated with a neighborhood of what can be called equivalently a phase transition, a bifurcation, a catastrophe (in the sense of René Thom), or a tipping point. The presence of a phase transition is crucial to learn how to diagnose in advance the symptoms associated with a coming dragon-king. Several examples of predictions using the derived log-periodic power law method are discussed, including material failure predictions and the forecasts of the termination of financial bubbles.},

Applications and the potential for prediction are discussed in relation to the rupture of composite materials, great earthquakes, turbulence, and abrupt changes of weather regimes, financial crashes, and human parturition (birth). Future improvements will involve combining ideas and tools from statistical physics and artificial/computational intelligence, to identify and classify possible universal structures that occur at different scales, and to develop application-specific methodologies to use these structures for prediction of the "crises" known to arise in each application of interest.

In this review, we cover the theory behind nonlinearity in dynamic systems and techniques to detect the loss of resilience that can indicate state transitions. We describe the research done on generic abundance-based signals of instability that are derived from the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which represent the genesis of EWSs research. We highlight some of the issues facing the detection of such signals in biological systems – which are inherently complex and show low signal-to-noise ratios. We then document research on alternative signals of instability, including measuring shifts in spatial autocorrelation and trait dynamics, and discuss potential future directions for EWSs research based on detailed demographic and phenotypic data. We set EWSs research in the greater field of predictive ecology and weigh up the costs and benefits of simplicity vs. complexity in predictive models, and how the available data should steer the development of future methods. Finally, we identify some key unanswered questions that, if solved, could improve the applicability of these methods.},

As an alternative, we suggest a simple, but highly flexible agent-based model (ABM), which, when applying EWS-analysis, gives reason to (a) consider social interaction, in particular negative feedback effects, as an essential trigger of critical transitions, and (b) to differentiate social interactions, for example in network representations, into a core and a periphery of agents and focus attention on the periphery. Results are tested against time series from a networked version of the Ising-model, which is often used as example for generating hysteretic critical transitions.},

   abstract = {There is currently much interest in examining climatic tipping points, to see if it is feasible to predict them in advance. Using techniques from bifurcation theory, recent work looks for a slowing down of the intrinsic transient responses, which is predicted to occur before an instability is encountered. This is done, for example, by determining the short-term autocorrelation coefficient ARC(1) in a sliding window of the time-series: this stability coefficient should increase to unity at tipping. Such studies have been made both on climatic computer models and on real paleoclimate data preceding ancient tipping events. The latter employ reconstituted time-series provided by ice cores, sediments, etc., and seek to establish whether the actual tipping could have been accurately predicted in advance. One such example is the end of the Younger Dryas event, about 11 500 years ago, when the Arctic warmed by 7°C in 50 yrs. A second gives an excellent prediction for the end of "greenhouse" Earth about 34 million years ago when the climate tipped from a tropical state into an icehouse state, using data from tropical Pacific sediment cores. This prediction science is very young, but some encouraging results are already being obtained. Future analyses will clearly need to embrace both real data from improved monitoring instruments, and simulation data generated from increasingly sophisticated predictive models. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Here, we leverage both types of information using paleoclimate data assimilation9,10 to produce the first proxy-constrained, full-field reanalysis of surface temperature change spanning the Last Glacial Maximum to present at 200-year resolution. We demonstrate that temperature variability across the past 24 thousand years was linked to two primary climatic mechanisms: radiative forcing from ice sheets and greenhouse gases; and a superposition of changes in the ocean overturning circulation and seasonal insolation. In contrast with previous proxy-based reconstructions6,7 our results show that global mean temperature has slightly but steadily warmed, by ~0.5 °C, since the early Holocene (around 9&nbsp;thousand years ago). When compared with recent temperature changes11, our reanalysis indicates that both the rate and magnitude of modern warming are unusual relative to the changes of the past 24&nbsp;thousand years.

Here, we seek to resolve some of the confusion by unfolding the dynamics of a simple consumer-resource interaction module. In what follows, we first review common dynamical metrics of stability (CV, eigenvalues). We argue using the classical type II consumer-resource model as an example where the empirical stability metric, CV, hides two different, but important, aspects of stability: (i) stability due to mean population density processes and (ii) stability due to population density variance processes. We then employ a simple stochastic consumer-resource framework in order to elucidate (i) when we expect these two different aspects of stability to arise in ecological systems and, importantly, highlight (ii) the fact that these two different aspects of stability respond differentially, but predictably, to changes in fundamental parameters that govern biomass flux and loss in any consumer-resource interaction (e.g., attack rates, carrying capacity, mortality).},

A classical bifurcation theory, a basis of the tipping dynamics of AMOC implicitly assumes that the tipping point is fixed. However, when a system is subjected to time-varying forcing (e.g., AMOC exposed to ice meltwater) an actual tipping point can be overshot due to delayed tipping, referred to as the slow passage effect. Here, using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity and a low-order model with freshwater forcing, we show that the tipping point of AMOC is largely delayed by the slow passage effect. It causes a large tipping lag of up to 1300 years, and strongly relaxes the abruptness of tipping as well. We further demonstrate that the tipping modulation can actively occur in past, present, and future climates by quantifying the effect during Dansgaard-Oeschger events, meltwater pulse 1A (MWP-1A), and current Greenland ice sheet melting. The suggested slow passage effect may explain the observed lagged AMOC collapse to MWP-1A of about 1000 years and provides implications tipping risk in the future.},

   abstract = {A climate state close to a tipping point will have a degenerate linear response to perturbations, which can be associated with extreme values of the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). In this paper we contrast linearized (‘instantaneous’) with fully nonlinear geometric (‘two-point’) notions of ECS, in both presence and absence of tipping points. For a stochastic energy balance model of the global mean surface temperature with two stable regimes, we confirm that tipping events cause the appearance of extremes in both notions of ECS. Moreover, multiple regimes with different mean sensitivities are visible in the two-point ECS. We confirm some of our findings in a physics-based multi-box model of the climate system.},

Such rate-dependent tipping, or R-tipping, need not be associated with either bifurcations or noise.

   abstract = {The possibility of rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) away from an attracting fixed point has been thoroughly explored in 1-dimensional systems. In these systems, it is impossible to have R-tipping away from a path of quasi-stable equilibria that is forward basin stable (FBS), but R-tipping is guaranteed for paths that are non-FBS of a certain type. We will investigate whether these results carry over to multi-dimensional systems. In particular, we will show that the same conditions guaranteeing R-tipping in 1-dimension also guarantee R-tipping in higher dimensions; however, it is possible to have R-tipping away from a path that is FBS even in 2-dimensional systems. We will propose a different condition, forward inflowing stability (FIS), which we show is sufficient to prevent R-tipping in all dimensions. The condition, while natural, is difficult to verify in concrete examples. Monotone systems are a class for which FIS is implied by an easily verifiable condition. As a result, we see how the additional structure of these systems makes predicting the possibility of R-tipping straightforward in a fashion similar to 1-dimension. In particular, we will prove that the FBS and FIS conditions in monotone systems reduce to comparing the relative positions of equilibria over time. An example of a monotone system is given that demonstrates how these ideas are applied to determine exactly when R-tipping is possible.},

   abstract = {Critical transitions or regime shifts are sudden and unexpected changes in the state of an ecosystem, that are usually associated with dangerous levels of environmental change. However, recent studies show that critical transitions can also be triggered by dangerous rates of environmental change. In contrast to classical regime shifts, such rate-induced critical transitions do not involve any obvious loss of stability, or a bifurcation, and thus cannot be explained by the linear stability analysis. In this work, we demonstrate that the well-known Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model can undergo a rate-induced critical transition in response to a continuous decline in the habitat quality, resulting in a collapse of the predator and prey populations. Rather surprisingly, the collapse occurs even if the environmental change is slower than the slowest process in the model. To explain this counterintuitive phenomenon, we combine methods from geometric singular perturbation theory with the concept of a moving equilibrium, and study critical rates of environmental change with dependence on the initial state and the system parameters. Moreover, for a fixed rate of environmental change, we determine the set of initial states that undergo a rate-induced population collapse. Our results suggest that ecosystems may be more sensitive to how fast environmental conditions change than previously assumed. In particular, unexpected critical transitions with dramatic ecological consequences can be triggered by environmental changes that (i) do not exceed any dangerous levels, and (ii) are slower than the natural timescales of the ecosystem. This poses an interesting research question whether regime shifts observed in the natural world are predominantly rate-induced or bifurcation-induced.},

   abstract = {Numerous systems in the climate sciences and elsewhere are excitable, exhibiting coexistence of and transitions between a basic and an excited state. We examine the role of tipping between two such states in an excitable low-order ocean model. Ensemble simulations are used to obtain the model’s pullback attractor (PBA) and its properties, as a function of a forcing parameter $$\gamma$$ and of the steepness $$\delta$$ of a climatological drift in the forcing. The tipping time $$t_\{\mathrm\{\{tp\}\}\}$$ is defined as the time at which the transition to relaxation oscillations (ROs) arises: at constant forcing this occurs at $$\gamma =\gamma _\{\mathrm\{c\}\}$$ . As the steepness $$\delta$$ decreases, $$t_\{\mathrm\{\{tp\}\}\}$$ is delayed and the corresponding forcing amplitude decreases, while remaining always above $$\gamma _\{\mathrm\{c\}\}$$ . With periodic perturbations, that amplitude depends solely on $$\delta$$ over a significant range of parameters: this provides an example of rate-induced tipping in an excitable system. Nonlinear resonance occurs for periods comparable to the RO time scale. Coexisting PBAs and total independence from initial states are found for subsets of parameter space. In the broader context of climate dynamics, the parameter drift herein stands for the role of anthropogenic forcing.},

@report{Ritchie2016,
   abstract = {A dynamical system is said to undergo rate-induced tipping when it fails to track its quasi-equilibrium state due to an above-critical-rate change of system parameters. We study a prototypical model for rate-induced tipping, the saddle-node normal form subject to time-varying equilibrium drift and noise. We find that both most commonly used early-warning indicators, increase in variance and increase in autocorrelation, occur not when the equilibrium drift is fastest but with a delay. We explain this delay by demonstrating that the most likely trajectory for tipping also crosses the tipping threshold with a delay and therefore the tipping itself is delayed. We find solutions of the variational problem determining the most likely tipping path using numerical continuation techniques. The result is a systematic study of the most likely tipping time in the plane of two parameters, distance from tipping threshold and noise intensity. The notion of tipping describes the phenomenon that at certain critical levels or rates the output of a system changes disproportionately compared to the change in input. Two particular examples in climate science are the possible collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) due to increasing freshwater input or the sudden release of carbon in peatlands due to an external temperature increase above a critical rate (the compost bomb instability 1). There is an ongoing debate, for example, in climate science 2 and ecology 3 whether it is possible to find early-warning indicators robustly in time series of system outputs before tipping occurs. This paper focuses on the case of rate-induced tipping, which describes the scenario where a system fails to track its equilibrium due to a rapid change in parameters. We show that two popular candidates for early-warning indicators in time series, an increase in autocorrelation and an increase in variance, appear to give a delayed warning signal for tipping. We study the phenomenon by looking at the interaction of rate-induced tipping and noise. We find that the most likely time for the noise to kick the system over the threshold (which is a curve in phase space) is after the point where the threshold is closest to the equilibrium. We investigate this tipping (and, correspondingly, early-warning) delay systematically depending on two parameters: the distance of the parameter drift speed from its critical value and the noise intensity. We find that the delay is larger for smaller noise-intensity.},

In addition, we aimed to construct a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for skewness and kurtosis values in various samples sizes. Materials and Methods: In our simulation study, 10,000 samples with replacement were taken from the standard normal population. Various sample sizes were evaluated. Data which were obtained from an animal study were used for comparison of t-test's and Wilcoxon sign test's power in small sample. Results: According to our results, sampling distribution of skewness coefficients has normal distribution; however, kurtosis coefficients have positively skewed distribution. A bootstrap confidence interval for these coefficients by using these sampling distribution can be used for normality test. Moreover, it was shown that test statistic for the mean has t-distribution in all studied sample sizes. Conclusion: We can say that distribution shape of the variable plays a more important role than sample size in selection of appropriate test statistic. © Medical Journal of Trakya University.

   abstract = {There is currently much interest in examining climatic tipping points, to see if it is feasible to predict them in advance. Using techniques from bifurcation theory, recent work looks for a slowing down of the intrinsic transient responses, which is predicted to occur before an instability is encountered. This is done, for example, by determining the short-term autocorrelation coefficient ARC(1) in a sliding window of the time-series: this stability coefficient should increase to unity at tipping. Such studies have been made both on climatic computer models and on real paleoclimate data preceding ancient tipping events. The latter employ reconstituted time-series provided by ice cores, sediments, etc., and seek to establish whether the actual tipping could have been accurately predicted in advance. One such example is the end of the Younger Dryas event, about 11 500 years ago, when the Arctic warmed by 7°C in 50 yrs. A second gives an excellent prediction for the end of "greenhouse" Earth about 34 million years ago when the climate tipped from a tropical state into an icehouse state, using data from tropical Pacific sediment cores. This prediction science is very young, but some encouraging results are already being obtained. Future analyses will clearly need to embrace both real data from improved monitoring instruments, and simulation data generated from increasingly sophisticated predictive models. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

   abstract = {Rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) occurs when time-variation of input parameters of a dynamical system interacts with system timescales to give genuine nonautonomous instabilities. Such instabilities appear as the input varies at some critical rates and cannot, in general, be understood in terms of autonomous bifurcations in the frozen system with a fixed-in-time input. This paper develops an accessible mathematical framework for R-tipping in multidimensional nonautonomous dynamical systems with an autonomous future limit. We focus on R-tipping via loss of tracking of base attractors that are equilibria in the frozen system, due to crossing what we call regular thresholds. These thresholds are associated with regular edge states: compact hyperbolic invariant sets with one unstable direction and orientable stable manifold, that lie on a basin boundary in the frozen system. We define R-tipping and critical rates for the nonautonomous system in terms of special solutions that limit to a compact invariant set of the future limit system that is not an attractor. We focus on the case when the limit set is a regular edge state, which we call the regular R-tipping edge state that anchors the associated regular R-tipping threshold at infinity. We introduce the concept of edge tails to rigorously classify R-tipping into reversible, irreversible, and degenerate cases. The main idea is to compactify the problem and use regular edge states of the future limit system to analyse R-tipping in the nonautonomous system. This allows us to give sufficient conditions for the occurrence of R-tipping in terms of easily testable properties of the frozen system and input variation, and necessary and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of reversible and irreversible R-tipping in terms of computationally verifiable (heteroclinic) connections to regular R-tipping edge states in the compactified system.},

   abstract = {The transformation of ecosystems proceeds at unprecedented rates. Recent studies suggest that high rates of environmental change can cause rate-induced tipping. In ecological models, the associated rate-induced critical transition manifests during transient dynamics in which populations drop to dangerously low densities. In this work, we study how indirect evolutionary rescue—due to the rapid evolution of a predator’s trait—can save a prey population from the rate-induced collapse. Therefore, we explicitly include the time-dependent dynamics of environmental change and evolutionary adaptation in an eco-evolutionary system. We then examine how fast the evolutionary adaptation needs to be to counteract the response to environmental degradation and express this relationship by means of a critical rate. Based on this critical rate, we conclude that indirect evolutionary rescue is more probable if the predator population possesses a high genetic variation and, simultaneously, the environmental change is slow. Hence, our results strongly emphasize that the maintenance of biodiversity requires a deceleration of the anthropogenic degradation of natural habitats.},

The probability of encountering such a 'rogue' wave was recently found to be much larger than expected from conventional wave-amplitude statistics. In an effort to understand the physics of such events, Solli et al. investigate the concept of optical rogue waves. Using a new real-time detection technique, they study a system — based on a microstructured optical fibre — that exposes extremely steep, large optical waves as rare outcomes from an injection of a population of almost-identical optical pulses. The optical rogue waves arise when random noise perturbs the initially smooth pulses with a certain frequency shift and within a well-defined time window. The concept of rogue waves in an optical system is investigated by utilizing a new real-time detection technique to study a system that exposes extremely steep, large optical waves as rare outcomes from injection of a population of almost-identical optical pulses. Analysis of these results finds that the optical rogue waves arise when random noise perturbs the initially smooth pulses with a certain frequency shift and within a well-defined time window. Recent observations show that the probability of encountering an extremely large rogue wave in the open ocean is much larger than expected from ordinary wave-amplitude statistics1,2,3. Although considerable effort has been directed towards understanding the physics behind these mysterious and potentially destructive events, the complete picture remains uncertain. Furthermore, rogue waves have not yet been observed in other physical systems. Here, we introduce the concept of optical rogue waves, a counterpart of the infamous rare water waves. Using a new real-time detection technique, we study a system that exposes extremely steep, large waves as rare outcomes from an almost identically prepared initial population of waves. Specifically, we report the observation of rogue waves in an optical system, based on a microstructured optical fibre, near the threshold of soliton-fission supercontinuum generation4,5—a noise-sensitive5,6,7 nonlinear process in which extremely broadband radiation is generated from a narrowband input8. We model the generation of these rogue waves using the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation9 and demonstrate that they arise infrequently from initially smooth pulses owing to power transfer seeded by a small noise perturbation.},

In the majority of cases, the water-wave problem is reduced to potential flow theory on a somehow simplified level. However, the nonlinear terms in the surface boundary conditions and the fact that they must be fulfilled on the unknown water surface make the boundary value problem considerably complex. Hereby, the contrary objectives with respect to a very accurate representation of reality and numerical efficiency must be balanced wisely. This paper investigates the influence of characteristic sea state parameters on the accuracy of irregular wave field simulations of different complexity. For this purpose, the high-order spectral method was applied and the underlying Taylor series expansion was truncated at different orders so that numerical simulations of different complexity can be investigated. It is shown that, for specific characteristic sea state parameters, the boundary value problem can be significantly reduced while providing sufficient accuracy.},

   abstract = {In this paper we study the influence of random noise on route to chaos followed by directly modulated laser diode as we found that is more complex than just a Feigenbaum sequence. We have already shown that when the laser is modulated at twice its resonance frequency and the modulation index is increased, a period tripling stable solution coexists with the Feigenbaum sequence for certain values of the modulation index, giving rise to hysteresis loops and chaotic bifurcations. This coexistence gives the noise a relevant role in determining the dynamic behavior. We have studied the route to chaos of the laser diode when the random noise fluctuations are introduced in the model. For this study, we have used three different numerical methods. We have employed a single step fourth order Runge- Kutta algorithm, which has been commonly used in previous studies, and its results have been compared to those provided by two stochastic integration methods: Euler- Maruyama and a stochastic Heun method. In all three cases, the behavior evolves from the single periodic response through period doubling, period quadrupling and period tripling in accordance with recent experimental studies, showing that in the route to chaos, the period doubling sequence is effectively truncated due to random noise. The reason for the truncation is found in the nearby coexisting period three solution. Nevertheless, the Runge-Kutta algorithm smoothes off the random noise fluctuations, probably due to its large correlation time. ©2003 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.},

   abstract = {Research on the possibility of future abrupt climate change has been popularized under the term 'tipping points' and has often been motivated by using simple, low-dimensional concepts. These include the iconic fold bifurcation, where abrupt change occurs when a stable equilibrium is lost, and early warning signals of such a destabilization that can be derived based on a simple stochastic model approach. In this paper, we review the challenges and limitations that are associated with this view, and we discuss promising research paths to explore the causes and the likelihood of abrupt changes in future climate. We focus on several climate system components and ecosystems that have been proposed as candidates for tipping points, with an emphasis on ice sheets, the Atlantic Ocean circulation, vegetation in North Africa and Arctic sea ice. In most example cases, multiple equilibria found in simple models do not appear in complex models or become more difficult to find, while the potential for abrupt change still remains. We also discuss how the low-dimensional logic of current methods to detect and interpret the existence of multiple equilibria can fail in complex models. Moreover, we highlight promising methods to detect abrupt shifts and to obtain information about the mechanisms behind them. These methods include linear approaches such as statistical stability indicators and radiative feedback analysis as well as non-linear approaches to detect dynamical transitions and infer the causality behind events. Given the huge complexity of comprehensive process-based climate models and the non-linearity and regional peculiarities of the processes involved, the uncertainties associated with the possible future occurrence of abrupt shifts are large and not well quantified.

Many socio-ecological systems are expected to collapse once pressure exceeds a tipping point. A fundamental problem is that the location of tipping points is almost always unknown. We take a stylized ecosystem model with an unknown tipping point and derive a standard EWS. We then demonstrate 15 the necessary steps to utilize the EWS and show why it improves ecosystem management. We discuss critical dimensions of EWS design and highlight that EWS may occasionally increase the risk of collapse, even in managed systems. Better understanding how, when, and why EWS may improve management is therefore an essential complement to the emerging knowledge on detecting EWS. (119 words) 20 JEL Classification: C61, D83, Q54},

The focus is the Stommel-Box, and related climate models, which are piecewise-smooth continuous dynamical systems, modeling thermohaline circulation. We obtain explicit asymptotic expressions for the behavior at tipping points in the settings of both slowly varying freshwater forcing and rapidly oscillatory fluctuations. The results, based on combined multiple scale and local analyses, provide conditions for the sudden transitions between temperature-dominated and salinity-dominated states. In the context of high frequency oscillations, a multiple scale averaging approach can be used instead of the usual geometric approach normally required for piecewise-smooth continuous systems. The explicit parametric dependencies of advances and lags in the tipping show a competition between dynamic features of the model. We make a contrast between the behavior of tipping points close to both smooth Saddle–Node Bifurcations and the non-smooth systems studied on this paper. In particular we show that the non-smooth case has earlier and more abrupt transitions. This result has clear implications for the design of early warning signals for tipping in the case of the non-smooth dynamical systems which often arise in climate models.},

Well-known indicators are the increase in spatial and temporal correlations. However, the performance of these indicators depends on the system under study and on the type of approaching bifurcation, and no indicator provides a reliable warning for any system and bifurcation. Here we propose an indicator that simultaneously takes into account information about spatial and temporal correlations. By performing a bivariate correlation analysis of signals recorded in pairs of adjacent spatial points, and analyzing the distribution of lag times that maximize the cross-correlation, we find that the variance of the lag distribution displays an extreme value that is a consistent early warning indicator of the approaching bifurcation. We demonstrate the reliability of this indicator using different types of models that present different types of bifurcations, including local bifurcations (transcritical, saddle-node, supercritical and subcritical Hopf), and global bifurcations.},

Here we use a novel formalism to map unstable fixed points to singularities of turbulent flows and to trace the evolution of their structural characteristics when moving from small to large scales and vice versa, providing a full characterization of the attractor. We demonstrate that the properties of the dynamically invariant objects depend on the scale we are focusing on.

To date, the majority of studies on the predictability of critical transitions consider systems perturbed with temporally uncorrelated noise. In contrast, here we study catastrophic and non-catastrophic transitions, and the performance of associated EWSs in systems perturbed with correlated noise. We find that elevated noise correlation can advance the occurrence of a catastrophic transition, and simultaneously progresses the system’s recovery. However, noise correlation does not have a significant impact on the likelihood of non-catastrophic transitions. We show that depending upon the transition mechanism, the occurrence of weak to false signals increases with noise reddening. Imperfect data sampling, both spatial and temporal, further reduces the efficacy of EWSs. Spatially limited data has more impact on the efficacy of EWSs for negative noise correlation than that of positive. However, temporally imperfect data is more detrimental for positively correlated noise. Overall, our study suggests that performance of EWSs is critical to system-specific perturbations as well as data sampling.},

   abstract = {Prediction of ecosystem response to global environmental change is a pressing scientific challenge of major societal relevance. Many ecosystems display nonlinear responses to environmental change, and may even undergo practically irreversible ‘regime shifts’ that initiate ecosystem collapse. Recently, early warning signals based on spatiotemporal metrics have been proposed for the identification of impending regime shifts. The rapidly increasing availability of remotely sensed data provides excellent opportunities to apply such model-based spatial early warning signals in the real world, to assess ecosystem resilience and identify impending regime shifts induced by global change. Such information would allow land-managers and policy makers to interfere and avoid catastrophic shifts, but also to induce regime shifts that move ecosystems to a desired state. Here, we show that the application of spatial early warning signals in real-world landscapes presents unique and unexpected challenges, and may result in misleading conclusions when employed without careful consideration of the spatial data and processes at hand. We identify key practical and theoretical issues and provide guidelines for applying spatial early warning signals in heterogeneous, real-world landscapes based on literature review and examples from real-world data. Major identified issues include (1) spatial heterogeneity in real-world landscapes may enhance reversibility of regime shifts and boost landscape-level resilience to environmental change (2) ecosystem states are often difficult to define, while these definitions have great impact on spatial early warning signals and (3) spatial environmental variability and socio-economic factors may affect spatial patterns, spatial early warning signals and associated regime shift predictions. We propose a novel framework, shifting from an ecosystem perspective towards a landscape approach. The framework can be used to identify conditions under which resilience assessment with spatial remotely sensed data may be successful, to support well-informed application of spatial early warning signals, and to improve predictions of ecosystem responses to global environmental change.},

   abstract = {Complex systems from different fields of knowledge often do not allow a mathematical description or modeling, because of their intricate structure composed of numerous interacting components. As an alternative approach, it is possible to study the way in which observables associated with the system fluctuate in time. These time series may provide valuable information about the underlying dynamics. It has been suggested that complex dynamic systems, ranging from ecosystems to financial markets and the climate, produce generic early-warning signals at the "tipping points," where they announce a sudden shift toward a different dynamical regime, such as a population extinction, a systemic market crash, or abrupt shifts in the weather. On the other hand, the framework of Self-Organized Criticality (SOC), suggests that some complex systems, such as life itself, may spontaneously converge toward a critical point. As a particular example, the quasispecies model suggests that RNA viruses self-organize their mutation rate near the error-catastrophe threshold, where robustness and evolvability are balanced in such a way that survival is optimized. In this paper, we study the time series associated to a classical discrete quasispecies model for different mutation rates, and identify early-warning signals for critical mutation rates near the error-catastrophe threshold, such as irregularities in the kurtosis and a significant increase in the autocorrelation range, reminiscent of 1/f noise. In the present context, we find that the early-warning signals, rather than broadcasting the collapse of the system, are the fingerprint of survival optimization. © 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

EWSs are model-independent methods that have grown in popularity to support evidence of disease emergence and disease elimination. Theoretical work has demonstrated their capability of detecting disease transitions in simple epidemic models, where elimination is reached through vaccination, to more complex vector transmission, age-structured and metapopulation models. However, the exact time evolution of EWSs depends on the transition; here we review the literature to provide guidance on what trends to expect and when. Recent advances include methods which detect when an EWS becomes significant; the earlier an upcoming disease transition is detected, the more valuable an EWS will be in practice. We suggest that future work should firstly validate detection methods with synthetic and historical datasets, before addressing their performance with real-time data which is accruing. A major challenge to overcome for the use of EWSs with disease transitions is to maintain the accuracy of EWSs in data-poor settings. We demonstrate how EWSs behave on reported cases for pertussis in the USA, to highlight some limitations when detecting disease transitions with real-world data.},

   abstract = {Many complex networks in natural and social phenomena have often been characterized by heavy-tailed degree distributions. However, due to rapidly growing size of network data and concerns on privacy issues about using these data, it becomes more difficult to analyze complete data sets. Thus, it is crucial to devise effective and efficient estimation methods for heavy tails of degree distributions in large-scale networks only using local information of a small fraction of sampled nodes. Here we propose a tail-scope method based on local observational bias of the friendship paradox. We show that the tail-scope method outperforms the uniform node sampling for estimating heavy tails of degree distributions, while the opposite tendency is observed in the range of small degrees. In order to take advantages of both sampling methods, we devise the hybrid method that successfully recovers the whole range of degree distributions. Our tail-scope method shows how structural heterogeneities of large-scale complex networks can be used to effectively reveal the network structure only with limited local information.},

Investigations of freak-wave events appearing within longtime evolutions of 2-D and 3-D wavefields in open seas are then realized, and the results are discussed. Such events are obtained in our periodic-domain HOS model by using different kinds of configurations: either i) we impose an initial 3-D directional spectrum with the phases adjusted so as to form a focused forced event after a while, or ii) we let 2-D and 3-D wavefields defined by a directional wave spectrum evolve up to the natural appearance of freak waves.

   abstract = {It is well known that the spectral peak of wind-induced gravity waves on the sea surface tends to shift to lower frequencies as the fetch increases. In past theories the nonlinear dynamics subsequent to Benjamin–Feir instability has been found to initiate the downshift in narrow-banded waves in the absence of wind. However, these weakly nonlinear theories all predict the downshift to be only the first phase of an almost cyclic process. Limited by the length of a wave tank, existing experiments are usually made with relatively steep waves which often break. Although there is a theory on how breaking adds dissipation to stop the reversal of the initial trend of downshift, the details of breaking must be crudely characterized by semi-empirical hypotheses.Since the direct role of wind itself must be relevant to the entire development of wind-wave spectrum, we examine here the effect of wind on the nonlinear evolution of unstable sidebands in narrow-banded waves. We assume that the waves do not break and consider the case where the nonlinear effects that initiate the downshift, energy input by wind and damping by internal dissipation all occur on the same timescale. This means that not only must the waves be mild but the wind stress intensity must also lie within a certain narrow range. With these limitations we couple the air flow above the waves with Dysthe's extension of the cubic Schrödinger equation, and examine the initial as well as the long-time evolution of a mechanically generated wavetrain. For a variety of wind intensities, downshift is indeed found to be enhanced and rendered long lasting.},

   abstract = {Most of the Earth’s surface is covered by water. Many aspects of our everyday lives and activities may be affected by water waves in some way. Sometimes, the waves can cause disaster. One of the examples was the tsunami that occurred in the Indian Ocean on 26 December 2004. This indicates how important it is for us to fully understand water waves, in particular the very large ones. One way to do so is to perform numerical simulation based on the nonlinear theory. Considerable research advances have been made in this area over the past decade by developing various numerical methods and applying them to emerging problems; however, until now there has been no comprehensive book to reflect these advances. This unique volume aims to bridge this gap. This book contains 18 self-contained chapters written by more than 50 authors from 12 different countries, many of whom are world-leading experts in the field. Each chapter is based mainly on the pioneering work of the authors and their research teams over the past decades. The chapters altogether deal with almost all numerical methods that have been employed so far to simulate nonlinear water waves and cover many important and very interesting applications, such as overturning waves, breaking waves, waves generated by landslides, freak waves, solitary waves, tsunamis, sloshing waves, interaction of extreme waves with beaches, interaction with fixed structures, and interaction with free-response floating structures. Therefore, this book provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art research and key achievements in numerical modeling of nonlinear water waves, and serves as a unique reference for postgraduates, researchers and senior engineers working in industry.},

   abstract = {Ecological communities and other complex systems can undergo abrupt and long-lasting reorganization, a regime shift, when deterministic or stochastic factors bring them to the vicinity of a tipping point between alternative states. Such changes can be large and often arise unexpectedly. However, theoretical and experimental analyses have shown that changes in correlation structure, variance, and other standard indicators of biomass, abundance, or other descriptive variables are often observed prior to a state shift, providing early warnings of an anticipated transition. Natural systems manifest unknown mixtures of ecological and environmental processes, hampered by noise and limited observations. As data quality often cannot be improved, it is important to choose the best modeling tools available for the analysis. We investigate three autoregressive models and analyze their theoretical differences and practical performance. We formulate a novel probabilistic method for early warning signal detection and demonstrate performance improvements compared to nonprobabilistic alternatives based on simulation and publicly available experimental time series. The probabilistic formulation provides a novel approach to early warning signal detection and analysis, with enhanced robustness and treatment of uncertainties. In real experimental time series, the new probabilistic method produces results that are consistent with previously reported findings. Robustness to uncertainties is instrumental in the common scenario where mechanistic understanding of the complex system dynamics is not available. The probabilistic approach provides a new family of robust methods for early warning signal detection that can be naturally extended to incorporate variable modeling assumptions and prior knowledge.},

   abstract = {Stochastic averaging allows for the reduction of the dimension and complexity of stochastic dynamical systems with multiple time scales, replacing fast variables with statistically equivalent stochastic processes in order to analyze variables evolving on the slow time scale. These procedures have been studied extensively for systems driven by Gaussian noise, but very little attention has been given to the case of α-stable noise forcing which arises naturally from heavy-tailed stochastic perturbations. In this paper, we study nonlinear fast-slow stochastic dynamical systems in which the fast variables are driven by additive α-stable noise perturbations and the slow variables depend linearly on the fast variables. Using a combination of perturbation methods and Fourier analysis, we derive stochastic averaging approximations for the statistical contributions of the fast variables to the slow variables. In the case that the diffusion term of the reduced model depends on the state of the slow variable, we show that this term is interpreted in terms of the Marcus calculus. For the case α = 2, which corresponds to Gaussian noise, the results are consistent with previous results for stochastic averaging in the Gaussian case. Although the main results are derived analytically for 1 < α < 2, we provide evidence of their validity for α < 1 with numerical examples. We numerically simulate both linear and nonlinear systems and the corresponding reduced models, demonstrating good agreement for their stationary distributions and temporal dependence properties.},

   abstract = {We consider the effect on tipping from an additive periodic forcing in a canonical model with a saddle node bifurcation and a slowly varying bifurcation parameter. Here tipping refers to the dramatic change in dynamical behavior characterized by a rapid transition away from a previously attracting state. In the absence of the periodic forcing, it is well known that a slowly varying bifurcation parameter produces a delay in this transition, beyond the bifurcation point for the static case. Using a multiple scales analysis, we consider the effect of amplitude and frequency of the periodic forcing relative to the drifting rate of the slowly varying bifurcation parameter. We show that a high frequency oscillation drives an earlier tipping when the bifurcation parameter varies more slowly, with the advance of the tipping point proportional to the square of the ratio of amplitude to frequency. In the low frequency case the position of the tipping point is affected by the frequency, amplitude, and phase of the oscillation. The results are based on an analysis of the local concavity of the trajectory, used for low frequencies both of the same order as the drifting rate of the bifurcation parameter and for low frequencies larger than the drifting rate. The tipping point location is advanced with increased amplitude of the periodic forcing, with critical amplitudes where there are jumps in the location, yielding significant advances in the tipping point. We demonstrate the analysis for two applications with saddle node-type bifurcations.},

@article{Fang2018,
   abstract = {ABSTRACTIn statistical inverse problems, the objective is a complete statistical description of unknown parameters from noisy observations to quantify uncertainties in unknown parameters. We consider inverse problems with partial-differential-equation (PDE) constraints, which are applicable to many seismic problems. Bayesian inference is one of the most widely used approaches to precisely quantify statistics through a posterior distribution, incorporating uncertainties in observed data, modeling kernel, and prior knowledge of parameters. Typically when formulating the posterior distribution, the PDE constraints are required to be exactly satisfied, resulting in a highly nonlinear forward map and a posterior distribution with many local maxima. These drawbacks make it difficult to find an appropriate approximation for the posterior distribution. Another complicating factor is that traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are known to converge slowly for realistically sized problems. To overcome these drawbacks, we relax the PDE constraints by introducing an auxiliary variable, which allows for Gaussian errors in the PDE and yields a bilinear posterior distribution with weak PDE constraints that is more amenable to uncertainty quantification because of its special structure. We determine that for a particular range of variance choices for the PDE misfit term, the new posterior distribution has fewer modes and can be well-approximated by a Gaussian distribution, which can then be sampled in a straightforward manner. Because it is prohibitively expensive to explicitly construct the dense covariance matrix of the Gaussian approximation for problems with more than 105 unknowns, we have developed a method to implicitly construct it, which enables efficient sampling. We apply this framework to 2D seismic inverse problems with 1800 and 92,455 unknown parameters. The results illustrate that our framework can produce comparable statistical quantities with those produced by conventional MCMC-type methods while requiring far fewer PDE solves, which are the main computational bottlenecks in these problems.},

The proposed method aims to take advantage of the fact that some input directions of the black-box function have a larger impact on the output than others, which is important especially for systems exhibiting rare and extreme events. The acquisition functions introduced in this work leverage the properties of the likelihood ratio, a quantity that acts as a probabilistic sampling weight and guides the active-learning algorithm toward regions of the input space that are deemed most relevant.

This is the most accurate explicit one proposed so far and should be used to compute k in wave-related models that require a large of number of wavelength calculations. The other explicit formula derived with the one-point iteration method has a maximum relative error of 0.1%, but is of a simple form and can be easily applied to compute k in any water depth with a hand calculator. The validity of the wave dispersion relation under the coastal conditions is also investigated based on the comprehensive field data on wave pressure and orbital velocity.},

   abstract = {The pioneering paper 'Optical rogue waves' by Solli et al (2007 Nature 450 1054) started the new subfield in optics. This work launched a great deal of activity on this novel subject. As a result, the initial concept has expanded and has been enriched by new ideas. Various approaches have been suggested since then. A fresh look at the older results and new discoveries has been undertaken, stimulated by the concept of 'optical rogue waves'. Presently, there may not by a unique view on how this new scientific term should be used and developed. There is nothing surprising when the opinion of the experts diverge in any new field of research. After all, rogue waves may appear for a multiplicity of reasons and not necessarily only in optical fibers and not only in the process of supercontinuum generation. We know by now that rogue waves may be generated by lasers, appear in wide aperture cavities, in plasmas and in a variety of other optical systems. Theorists, in turn, have suggested many other situations when rogue waves may be observed. The strict definition of a rogue wave is still an open question. For example, it has been suggested that it is defined as 'an optical pulse whose amplitude or intensity is much higher than that of the surrounding pulses'. This definition (as suggested by a peer reviewer) is clear at the intuitive level and can be easily extended to the case of spatial beams although additional clarifications are still needed. An extended definition has been presented earlier by N Akhmediev and E Pelinovsky (2010 Eur. Phys. J. Spec. Top. 185 1-4). Discussions along these lines are always useful and all new approaches stimulate research and encourage discoveries of new phenomena. Despite the potentially existing disagreements, the scientific terms 'optical rogue waves' and 'extreme events' do exist. Therefore coordination of our efforts in either unifying the concept or in introducing alternative definitions must be continued. From this point of view, a number of the scientists who work in this area of research have come together to present their research in a single review article that will greatly benefit all interested parties of this research direction. Whether the authors of this 'roadmap' have similar views or different from the original concept, the potential reader of the review will enrich their knowledge by encountering most of the existing views on the subject. Previously, a special issue on optical rogue waves (2013 J. Opt. 15 060201) was successful in achieving this goal but over two years have passed and more material has been published in this quickly emerging subject. Thus, it is time for a roadmap that may stimulate and encourage further research.},

   abstract = {This paper studies the second-order currents and changes in mean surface level which are caused by gravity waves of non-uniform amplitude. The effects are interpreted in terms of the radiation stresses in the waves.The first example is of wave groups propagated in water of uniform mean depth. The problem is solved first by a perturbation analysis. In two special cases the second-order currents are found to be proportional simply to the square of the local wave amplitude: (a) when the lengths of the groups are large compared to the mean depth, and (b) when the groups are all of equal length. Then the surface is found to be depressed under a high group of waves and the mass-transport is relatively negative there. In case (a) the result can be simply related to the radiation stresses, which tend to expel fluid from beneath the higher waves.The second example considered is the propagation of waves of steady amplitude in water of gradually varying depth. Assuming no loss of energy by friction or reflexion, the wave amplitude must vary horizontally, to maintain the flux of energy constant; it is shown that this produces a negative tilt in the mean surface level as the depth diminishes. However, if the wave height is limited by breaking, the tilt is positive. The results are in agreement with some observations by Fairchild.Lastly, the propagation of groups of waves from deep to shallow water is studied. As the mean depth decreases, so the response of the fluid to the radiation stresses tends to increase. The long waves thus generated may be reflected as free waves, and so account for the 'surf beats’ observed by Munk and Tucker.Generalle speaking, the changes in mean sea level produced by ocean waves are comparable with those due to horizontal wind stress. It may be necessary to allow for the wave stresses in calculating wind stress coefficients.},

   abstract = {In order to calculate the mean mass flux past a given recording station it is necessary to know more than the mean velocity in a fixed, vertical section. One must add an additional term-the 'Stokes velocity' which depends also on the time and distance scales of the fluctuating currents. In typical circumstances, where the fluctuations are larger than the mean current, the Stokes velocity may dominate the mass transport, and lead to the mass transport being opposite in direction to the mean current. Some general expressions are given for the Stokes velocity, and these are studied in detail for the particular case of waves propagated along a sloping sea bed (double Kelvin waves). Such waves are always propagated with the shallower water to their right in the northern hemisphere. It is shown that in regions of small bottom gradient the Stokes velocity is in the same direction as the phase velocity, but in the region of large bottom gradient the sign of the Stokes velocity is reversed. The mean Stokes velocity is in the direction of wave propagation. However, the total transport (integrated with respect to the depth and width) is in the opposite direction. © 1969.},

   abstract = {We discuss the coupling processes between surface gravity waves and adjacent winds and currents in turbulent boundary layers. These processes mediate exchanges of momentum, heat, and gases between the atmosphere and ocean and thus are of global significance for climate. Surface waves grow primarily by pressure-form stress from airflow over the waveforms, and they dissipate in the open sea by wave breaking that injects and stirs momentum, energy, and bubbles into the ocean. Wave motions pump wind eddies that control fluxes across the lower atmosphere. Flow separation occurs behind steep wave crests, and at high winds the crests flatten into spume, which diminishes the drag coefficient. In the ocean the Lagrangian-mean wave velocity, Stokes drift, induces a vortex force and material transport. These generate Langmuir circulations penetrating throughout the boundary layer and enhancing entrainment at the stratified interior interface in combination with other turbulent eddies and inertial-shear instability.

   abstract = {We present a new spectral method to simulate numerically the waterwave problem in a channel for a fluid of finite or infinite depth. It is formulated in terms of the free surface elevation η and the velocity potential φ\{symbol\}. The numerical method is based on the reduction of this problem to a lower-dimensional computation involving surface variables alone. To accomplish this, we describe the Taylor expansion of the Dirichlet Neumann operator in homogeneous powers of the surface elevation η. Each term is a concatenation of Fourier multipliers with powers of η and its derivatives and is valid uniformly in wavenumber. These are easily calculated using the fast Fourier transform. The method is illustrated by computing the long time evolution of modulated wave packets and of approximations to the Stokes steady wave train. By imposing a surface pressure we observe surface steepening in large amplitude evolution, and wake and bow wave development for flows with a close to critical Froude number. Finally, we give an example of nonlinear evolution of the distribution of energy among normal modes. © 1993 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

A corresponding time-stepping scheme is developed in the two-dimensional case. The essential part of the method is a fast converging iterative solution procedure of the Laplace equation. One part of the solution is obtained by fast Fourier transform, while another part is highly nonlinear and consists of integrals with kernels that decay quickly in space. The number of operations required is asymptotically O(N log N), where N is the number of nodes at the free surface. While any accuracy of the computations is achieved by a continued iteration of the equations, one iteration is found to be sufficient for practical computations, while maintaining high accuracy. The resulting explicit approximation of the scheme is tested in two versions. Simulations of nonlinear wave fields with wave slope even up to about unity compare very well with reference computations. The numerical scheme is formulated in such a way that aliasing terms are partially or completely avoided.},

The results show that a well-defined freak wave may occur in the developed wind-wave condition: S(f)∝f-4, with single-peak directional spectra. The crest and trough amplitude distributions of the observed sea waves including freak waves are different from the Rayleigh distribution, although the wave height distribution tends to agree with the Rayleigh distribution.

However, the importance of this instability in the context of ocean waves is not well established. This mechanism has been successfully studied in laboratory experiments and in mathematical studies, but there is no consensus on what actually takes place in the ocean. In this work, we question the oceanic relevance of this paradigm. In particular, we analyze several sets of field data in various European locations with various tools and find that the main generation mechanism for rogue waves is the constructive interference of elementary waves enhanced by second-order bound nonlinearities and not the modulational instability. This implies that rogue waves are likely to be rare occurrences of weakly nonlinear random seas.},

   abstract = {Many dynamical systems, including lakes, organisms, ocean circulation patterns, or financial markets, are now thought to have tipping points where critical transitions to a contrasting state can happen. Because critical transitions can occur unexpectedly and are difficult to manage, there is a need for methods that can be used to identify when a critical transition is approaching. Recent theory shows that we can identify the proximity of a system to a critical transition using a variety of so-called 'early warning signals', and successful empirical examples suggest a potential for practical applicability. However, while the range of proposed methods for predicting critical transitions is rapidly expanding, opinions on their practical use differ widely, and there is no comparative study that tests the limitations of the different methods to identify approaching critical transitions using time-series data. Here, we summarize a range of currently available early warning methods and apply them to two simulated time series that are typical of systems undergoing a critical transition. In addition to a methodological guide, our work offers a practical toolbox that may be used in a wide range of fields to help detect early warning signals of critical transitions in time series data. © 2012 Dakos et al.},

   abstract = {We consider the effect of slowly varying depth on the values of skewness and kurtosis of weakly nonlinear irregular waves propagating from deeper to shallower water. It is known that the equilibrium value of kurtosis decreases with decreasing depth for waves propagating on constant depth. Waves propagating over a sloping bottom must continually adjust toward a new equilibrium state. We demonstrate that weakly nonlinear waves may need a considerable horizontal propagation distance in order to adjust to a new shallower environment, therefore the kurtosis can be notably different from the equilibrium value for each corresponding depth both on top of and beyond a bottom slope. A change of depth can provoke a wake-like spatially non-uniform distribution of kurtosis on the lee side of the slope. As an application, we anticipate that the probability of freak waves on or near the edge of the continental shelf may exhibit a rather complicated spatial structure for wave fields entering from deep sea. ? 2012 Author(s) CC Attribution 3.0 License.},

Theoretical interpretations considering the brain as a dynamical system suggest that prior to a seizure, recorded brain signals may exhibit critical slowing down, a warning signal preceding many critical transitions in dynamical systems. Using long-term intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from fourteen patients with focal epilepsy, we monitored key signatures of critical slowing down prior to seizures. The metrics used to detect critical slowing down fluctuated over temporally long scales (hours to days), longer than would be detectable in standard clinical evaluation settings. Seizure risk was associated with a combination of these signals together with epileptiform discharges. These results provide strong validation of theoretical models and demonstrate that critical slowing down is a reliable indicator that could be used in seizure forecasting algorithms.},

   abstract = {The Amazon rainforest has been proposed as a tipping element of the earth system, with the possibility of a dieback of the entire ecosystem due to deforestation only of parts of the rainforest. Possible physical mechanisms behind such a transition are still subject to ongoing debates. Here, we use a specifically designed model to analyse the nonlinear couplings between the Amazon rainforest and the atmospheric moisture transport from the Atlantic to the South American continent. These couplings are associated with a westward cascade of precipitation and evapotranspiration across the Amazon. We investigate impacts of deforestation on the South American monsoonal circulation with particular focus on a previously neglected positive feedback related to condensational latent heating over the rainforest, which strongly enhances atmospheric moisture inflow from the Atlantic. Our results indicate the existence of a tipping point. In our model setup, crossing the tipping point causes precipitation reductions of up to 40% in non-deforested parts of the western Amazon and regions further downstream. The responsible mechanism is the breakdown of the aforementioned feedback, which occurs when deforestation reduces transpiration to a point where the available atmospheric moisture does not suffice anymore to release the latent heat needed to maintain the feedback.},

   abstract = {In this paper we provide a connection between the geometrical properties of the attractor of a chaotic dynamical system and the distribution of extreme values. We show that the extremes of so-called physical observables are distributed according to the classical generalised Pareto distribution and derive explicit expressions for the scaling and the shape parameter. In particular, we derive that the shape parameter does not depend on the chosen observables, but only on the partial dimensions of the invariant measure on the stable, unstable, and neutral manifolds. The shape parameter is negative and is close to zero when high-dimensional systems are considered. This result agrees with what was derived recently using the generalized extreme value approach. Combining the results obtained using such physical observables and the properties of the extremes of distance observables, it is possible to derive estimates of the partial dimensions of the attractor along the stable and the unstable directions of the flow. Moreover, by writing the shape parameter in terms of moments of the extremes of the considered observable and by using linear response theory, we relate the sensitivity to perturbations of the shape parameter to the sensitivity of the moments, of the partial dimensions, and of the Kaplan-Yorke dimension of the attractor. Preliminary numerical investigations provide encouraging results on the applicability of the theory presented here. The results presented here do not apply for all combinations of Axiom A systems and observables, but the breakdown seems to be related to very special geometrical configurations. © 2014 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Evidence suggests that several elements of the climate system could be tipped into a different state by global warming, causing irreversible economic damages. To address their policy implications, we incorporated five interacting climate tipping points into a stochastic-dynamic integrated assessment model, calibrating their likelihoods and interactions on results from an existing expert elicitation. Here we show that combining realistic assumptions about policymakers' preferences under uncertainty, with the prospect of multiple future interacting climate tipping points, increases the present social cost of carbon in the model nearly eightfold from US$15 per tCO2 to US$116 per tCO2. Furthermore, passing some tipping points increases the likelihood of other tipping points occurring to such an extent that it abruptly increases the social cost of carbon. The corresponding optimal policy involves an immediate, massive effort to control CO2 emissions, which are stopped by mid-century, leading to climate stabilization at <1.5\{\thinspace\}\{\textdegree\}C above pre-industrial levels.},

We introduce information dissipation length (IDL) as a leading indicator of global instability of dynamical systems based on the transmission of Shannon information and apply it to the time series of USD and EUR interest rate swaps (IRS). We find in both markets that the IDL steadily increases toward the bankruptcy, then peaks at the time of bankruptcy and decreases afterwards. Previously introduced indicators such as `critical slowing down' do not provide a clear leading indicator.

So far, the majority of such warning signals documented have been in highly controlled laboratory systems or in theoretical models. Data from wild populations, however, are typically restricted both temporally and spatially due to limited monitoring resources and intrinsic ecological heterogeneity—limitations that may affect the detectability of generic early warning signals, as they add additional stochasticity to population abundance estimates. Consequently, spatial and temporal subsampling may serve to either muffle or magnify early warning signals. Using a combination of theoretical models and analysis of experimental data, we evaluate the extent to which statistical warning signs are robust to data corruption.},

Dysthe (1979) showed that a significant improvement is found by taking the perturbation analysis one step further to 0(є4). One of the dominant new effects is the wave-induced mean flow. We elaborate the Dysthe approach by investigating the effect of the wave-induced flow on the long-time behaviour of the Benjamin—Feir instability. The occurrence of a wave-induced flow may give rise to a Doppler shift in the frequency of the carrier wave and therefore could explain the observed down-shift in experiment (Lake et al. 1977). However, we present arguments why this is not a proper explanation. Finally, we apply the Dysthe equations to a homogeneous random field of gravity waves and obtain the nonlinear energy-transfer function recently found by Dungey & Hui (1979). © 1983, Cambridge University Press.

   abstract = {The climate system occasionally experiences an abrupt change. However, it is very difficult to predict this change at present. Fortunately, some generic properties have been revealed before several different types of dynamical system near their own critical thresholds. These properties provide a possible way to give an early warning for an impending abrupt climate change. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the applicability of an early warning indicator of an abrupt change. On the basis of several simple fold models, we have systematically investigated the performance of the kurtosis coefficient as an early warning signal for an upcoming abrupt climate change. The testing results indicate that the kurtosis coefficient is a reliable warning indicator in most of cases whether a critical control parameter or the strength of an external forcing approaches a critical point. However, the strong noise can greatly shorten the effective warning time, and also can result in the reduction of the magnitude of a kurtosis coefficient when a dynamical system approaches its critical threshold. The missing data has almost no effect on the kurtosis coefficient in all of tests, even it is true when the missing data accounts for 20% of the total sample. We also found that the kurtosis coefficient does not work in some cases, which means that the kurtosis coefficient is not a universal early warning signal for an upcoming abrupt change.},

Numerical simulations demonstrate that the spectral mean typically decreases and that the spectral peak decreases for certain initial conditions. The linear stability analysis of the plane-wave solutions of the viscous Dysthe system demonstrates that waves with frequencies closer to zero decay more slowly than waves with frequencies further from zero.

   abstract = {We experimentally and numerically investigate the effect of wind forcing on the spectral dynamics of Akhmediev breathers, a wave-type known to model the modulation instability. We develop the wind model to the same order in wave steepness as the higher order modification of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, also referred to as the Dysthe equation. This results in an asymmetric wind term in the higher order, in addition to the leading order wind forcing term. The derived model is in good agreement with laboratory experiments within the range of the facility's length. We show that the leading order forcing term amplifies all frequencies equally and therefore induces only a broadening of the spectrum, while the asymmetric higher order term in the model enhances the higher frequencies more than the lower ones. Thus, the latter term induces a permanent upshift in the spectral mean. On the other hand, in contrast to the direct effect of wind forcing, wind can indirectly lead to frequency downshifts, due to dissipative effects such aswave breaking, or through the amplification of the intrinsic spectral asymmetry of the Dysthe equation. Furthermore, the definitions of the up- and downshift in terms of peak frequency and mean frequency, which are critical to relate our work to previous results, are highlighted and discussed.},

   abstract = {For both the academic and the financial communities it is a familiar stylized fact that stock market returns have negative skewness and severe excess kurtosis. This stylized fact has been supported by a vast collection of empirical studies. Given that the conventional measures of skewness and kurtosis are computed as an average and that averages are not robust, we ask: “How useful are the measures of skewness and kurtosis used in previous empirical studies?” To answer this question, we provide a survey of robust measures of skewness and kurtosis from the statistics literature and carry out extensive Monte Carlo simulations that compare the conventional measures with the robust measures of our survey. An application of the robust measures to daily S&P500 index data indicates that the stylized facts might have been accepted too readily. We suggest that looking beyond the standard skewness and kurtosis measures can provide deeper and more accurate insight into market returns behavior.},

   abstract = {Campaigns to eliminate infectious diseases could be greatly aided by methods for providing early warning signals of resurgence. Theory predicts that as a disease transmission system undergoes a transition from stability at the disease-free equilibrium to sustained transmission, it will exhibit characteristic behaviours known as critical slowing down, referring to the speed at which fluctuations in the number of cases are dampened, for instance the extinction of a local transmission chain after infection from an imported case. These phenomena include increases in several summary statistics, including lag-1 autocorrelation, variance and the first difference of variance. Here, we report the first empirical test of this prediction during the resurgence of malaria in Kericho, Kenya. For 10 summary statistics, we measured the approach to criticality in a rolling window to quantify the size of effect and directions. Nine of the statistics increased as predicted and variance, the first difference of variance, autocovariance, lag-1 autocorrelation and decay time returned early warning signals of critical slowing down based on permutation tests. These results show that time series of disease incidence collected through ordinary surveillance activities may exhibit characteristic signatures prior to an outbreak, a phenomenon that may be quite general among infectious disease systems.},

Here we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study to compare the performance of conventional and Hogg's estimators, considering the most frequent continuous distributions used in health, education, and social sciences (gamma, lognormal and exponential distributions). In order to determine the bias, precision and accuracy of the skewness and kurtosis estimators for each distribution we calculated the relative bias, the coefficient of variation, and the scaled root mean square error. The effect of sample size on the estimators is also analyzed. In addition, a SAS program for calculating both conventional and Hogg's estimators is presented. The results indicated that for the non-normal distributions investigated, the estimators of skewness and kurtosis which best reflect the shape of the distribution are Hogg's estimators. It should also be noted that Hogg's estimators are not as affected by sample size as are conventional estimators.},

The method is modified by employing Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) which improves the estimation of short-term decay, especially in climate records which generally possess power-law correlations. When the modified method is applied to GENIE-1 model output that simulates collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, the bifurcation point is correctly anticipated. In Greenland ice core paleotemperature data, for which the conventional degenerate fingerprinting is not applicable due to the short length of the series, the modified method detects the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions. The technique could in principle be used to anticipate future bifurcations in the climate system, but this will require high-resolution time series of the relevant data.},

While patterns of GrIS mass loss are well studied, the spatial and temporal evolution of GICs mass loss and the acting processes have remained unclear. Here we use a novel, 1\{\thinspace\}km surface mass balance product, evaluated against in situ and remote sensing data, to identify 1997 (\{\textpm\}5 years) as a tipping point for GICs mass balance. That year marks the onset of a rapid deterioration in the capacity of the GICs firn to refreeze meltwater. Consequently, GICs runoff increases 65% faster than meltwater production, tripling the post-1997 mass loss to 36\{\textpm\}16\{\thinspace\}Gt−1, or ∼14% of the Greenland total. In sharp contrast, the extensive inland firn of the GrIS retains most of its refreezing capacity for now, buffering 22% of the increased meltwater production. This underlines the very different response of the GICs and GrIS to atmospheric warming.},

Such critical thresholds have been suggested to exist for the disappearance of Arctic sea ice and the retreat of ice sheets: Once these ice masses have shrunk below an anticipated critical extent, the ice-albedo feedback might lead to the irreversible and unstoppable loss of the remaining ice. We here give an overview of our current understanding of such threshold behavior. By using conceptual arguments, we review the recent findings that such a tipping point probably does not exist for the loss of Arctic summer sea ice. Hence, in a cooler climate, sea ice could recover rapidly from the loss it has experienced in recent years. In addition, we discuss why this recent rapid retreat of Arctic summer sea ice might largely be a consequence of a slow shift in ice-thickness distribution, which will lead to strongly increased year-to-year variability of the Arctic summer sea-ice extent. This variability will render seasonal forecasts of the Arctic summer seaice extent increasingly difficult.We also discuss why, in contrast to Arctic summer sea ice, a tipping point is more likely to exist for the loss of the Greenland ice sheet and the West Antarctic ice sheet.},

The data structures and algorithms used are efficient enough to construct the complete calling context tree exposed during sampling. The profiler leverages information recorded by compilers for debugging or exception handling to record call path profiles even for highly-optimized code. We describe an implementation for the Tru64/Alpha platform. Experiments profiling the SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite demonstrate the low (2%-7%) overhead of this profiler.

The evolution of the norm (wave-action) and spectral mean of the full model are well captured by the reduced dynamics. Three regimes are found for the wind-viscosity balance: we classify them according to the attractor in the phase-plane of the degenerate four-wave mixing truncated system and to the shift of the spectral mean. Downshift can coexist with both forcing and damping, i.e. attraction to period-1 or period-2 solutions. Upshift is associated to stronger winds, i.e. to a net forcing where the attractor is always a period-1 solution. The applicability of our classification to experiments in long wave-tanks is verified.},

In this system, wave breaking, runup and reflection, wave interference and bathymetric effects are highlighted. Wave breaking is examined with respect to geometric, kinematic and energetic conditions, with consistent results. The breaking strength is characterized for spilling and plunging based on initial wave period and amplitude. Non-breaking waves are amplified by reflection, interference and the bathymetry leading to large runups. In a typical example inspired by a real-world bathymetry, the maximum runup amplification approaches a factor of 12 – large enough for a 3 m amplitude wave to overtop a 30 m cliff.},

This numerical modeling allowed us to directly compare simulations with recent results of laboratory measurements in Chabchoub. In order to achieve even higher physical accuracy, we employed fully nonlinear simulations of potential Euler equations. These simulations provided us with basic characteristics of long time evolution of rational solutions of the NLS equation in the case of near-breaking conditions.

Based on a low-dimensional approximation obtained by considering only three complex harmonic modes, we discuss how to stabilize a one-dimensional pattern in the form of train of large peaks sitting on a background and propagating over a significant distance. Our approach is based on a gradual depth variation, while its conceptual framework is the theory of autoresonance in nonlinear systems and leads to a quasi-frozen state. Three main stages are identified: amplification from small sideband amplitudes, separatrix crossing and adiabatic conversion to orbits oscillating around an elliptic fixed point. Analytical estimates on the three stages are obtained from the low-dimensional approximation and validated by NLSE simulations. Our result will contribute to understand the dynamical stabilization of nonlinear wave packets and the persistence of large undulatory events in hydrodynamics and other nonlinear dispersive media.},

Here, we report a measurement of an impressive and unique wave packet recorded in the Bay of Biscay in the North-East of the Atlantic Ocean. An analysis of the spatial extension of the packet that includes three large waves reveals that it extents for more than 1 km, with individual crests moving faster than 100 km/h. The central and largest wave in the packet was 27.8 m high in a sea with significant wave height of 11 m. A detailed analysis of the data using the nonlinear Fourier analysis reveals that the wave packet is characterized by a non trivial nonlinear content.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In particular, it is found that either management scheme, if applied along the longitudinal coordinate, making the underlying nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) self-defocusing in the course of disappearance of the PS, indeed stabilizes the global solution with respect to the modulational instability of the background. In the process, additional excitations are generated, namely, dispersive shock waves and, in some cases, also a pair of slowly separating dark solitons. Further, the nonlinearity-management format, which makes the NLSE defocusing outside of a finite domain in the transverse direction, enables the stabilization of the KMBs, in the form of confined oscillating states. On the other hand, a nonlinearity-management format applied periodically along the propagation direction, creates expanding patterns featuring multiplication of KMBs through their cascading fission.},

The derivation is based on a multi-layer generalization of the traditional columnar Ansatz. A perturbative development in a nonlinear parameter and a dispersive parameter allow us to obtain sets of equations, for the horizontal fluid velocity and the free surface, able to describe propagation of weakly nonlinear and dispersive surface waves moving in water with some prescribed initial constant vorticity. We have shown that vorticity plays a central role on the dispersive properties of the system. When it is weak, it acts as a correction in linear and nonlinear dispersive terms. When stronger, it can also influence the nondispersive behavior of the system. Explicit steady solutions of the system corresponding to zero, weak, normal or strong vorticity are obtained. They correspond to solitary waves. Evolution of the soliton celerity, amplitude and width for these four cases are discussed.},

In consequence of coupling through the non-linear boundary conditions at the free surface, energy is then transferred from the primary motion to the side bands at a rate that, as will be shown herein, can increase exponentially as the interaction proceeds. The result is that the wave train becomes highly irregular far from its origin, even when the departures from periodicity are scarcely detectable at the start. In this paper a theoretical investigation is made into the stability of periodic wave trains to small disturbances in the form of a pair of side-band modes, and Part 2 which will follow is an account of some experimental observations in accord with the present predictions. The main conclusion of the theory is that infinitesimal disturbances of the type considered will undergo unbounded magnification if 0 <6 <(J2)ka, where k and a are the fundamental wave-number and amplitude of the perturbed wave train.

The current study focuses on waves with frequencies between 0.55 and 3.45 times the peak frequency fp. For the dominant frequency, the integration of the frequency-dependent BWHD provides a breaking probability that reproduces the known threshold-type behavior of the breaking probability for dominant waves.

In the latter, the spectrum is truncated to only the fundamental frequency and the upper and lower sidebands. Our experiments are performed on deep water waves, which are better described by the higher-order NLSE, the Dysthe equation. We therefore extend our analysis to this system. However, our conclusions are general for NLSE systems. By means of experimentally obtained phase-space trajectories, we demonstrate that forcing and damping cause a separatrix crossing during the evolution. When the system is damped, it is pulled outside the separatrix, which in the real space corresponds to a phase-shift of the envelope and therefore doubles the period of the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou recurrence cycle. When the system is forced by the wind, it is pulled inside the separatrix, lifting the phase-shift. Furthermore, we observe a growth and decay cycle for modulated plane waves that are conventionally considered stable. Finally, we give a theoretical demonstration that forcing the NLSE system can induce symmetry breaking during the evolution.},

   abstract = {The Benjamin-Feir instability is a modulational instability in which a uniform train of oscillatory waves of moderate amplitude loses energy to a small perturbation of other waves with nearly the same frequency and direction. The concept is well established in water waves, in plasmas and in optics. In each of these applications, the nonlinear Schrödinger equation is also well established as an approximate model based on the same assumptions as required for the derivation of the Benjamin-Feir theory: a narrow-banded spectrum of waves of moderate amplitude, propagating primarily in one direction in a dispersive medium with little or no dissipation. In this paper, we show that for waves with narrow bandwidth and moderate amplitude, any amount of dissipation (of a certain type) stabilizes the instability. We arrive at this stability result first by proving it rigorously for a damped version of the nonlinear Schr̈dinger equation, and then by confirming our theoretical predictions with laboratory experiments on waves of moderate amplitude in deep water. The Benjamin-Feir instability is often cited as the first step in a nonlinear process that spreads energy from an initially narrow bandwidth to a broader bandwidth. In this process, sidebands grow exponentially until nonlinear interactions eventually bound their growth. In the presence of damping, this process might still occur, but our work identifies another possibility: damping can stop the growth of perturbations before nonlinear interactions become important. In this case, if the perturbations are small enough initially, then they never grow large enough for nonlinear interactions to become important. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.},

Although considerable effort has been directed towards understanding the physics behind these mysterious and potentially destructive events, the complete picture remains uncertain. Furthermore, rogue waves have not yet been observed in other physical systems. Here, we introduce the concept of optical rogue waves, a counterpart of the infamous rare water waves. Using a new real-time detection technique, we study a system that exposes extremely steep, large waves as rare outcomes from an almost identically prepared initial population of waves. Specifically, we report the observation of rogue waves in an optical system, based on a microstructured optical fibre, near the threshold of soliton-fission supercontinuum generation - a noise-sensitive nonlinear process in which extremely broadband radiation is generated from a narrowband input. We model the generation of these rogue waves using the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation and demonstrate that they arise infrequently from initially smooth pulses owing to power transfer seeded by a small noise perturbation. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

   abstract = {The field of nonlinear dispersive waves has developed enormously since the work of Stokes, Boussinesq and Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) in the nineteenth century. In the 1960s, researchers developed effective asymptotic methods for deriving nonlinear wave equations, such as the KdV equation, governing a broad class of physical phenomena that admit special solutions including those commonly known as solitons. This book describes the underlying approximation techniques and methods for finding solutions to these and other equations. The concepts and methods covered include wave dispersion, asymptotic analysis, perturbation theory, the method of multiple scales, deep and shallow water waves, nonlinear optics including fiber optic communications, mode-locked lasers and dispersion-managed wave phenomena. Most chapters feature exercise sets, making the book suitable for advanced courses or for self-directed learning. Graduate students and researchers will find this an excellent entry to a thriving area at the intersection of applied mathematics, engineering and physical science.},

   abstract = {For more than 200 years, the Fourier Transform has been one of the most important mathematical tools for understanding the dynamics of linear wave trains. Nonlinear Ocean Waves and the Inverse Scattering Transform presents the development of the nonlinear Fourier analysis of measured space and time series, which can be found in a wide variety of physical settings including surface water waves, internal waves, and equatorial Rossby waves. This revolutionary development will allow hyperfast numerical modelling of nonlinear waves, greatly advancing our understanding of oceanic surface and internal waves. Nonlinear Fourier analysis is based upon a generalization of linear Fourier analysis referred to as the inverse scattering transform, the fundamental building block of which is a generalized Fourier series called the Riemann theta function. Elucidating the art and science of implementing these functions in the context of physical and time series analysis is the goal of this book.presents techniques and methods of the inverse scattering transform for data analysis geared toward both the introductory and advanced reader venturing further into mathematical and numerical analysis suitable for classroom teaching as well as research},

   abstract = {Rogue waves is the name given by oceanographers to isolated large amplitude waves, that occur more frequently than expected for normal, Gaussian distributed, statistical events. Rogue waves are ubiquitous in nature and appear in a variety of different contexts. Besides water waves, they have been recently reported in liquid Helium, in nonlinear optics, microwave cavities, etc. The first part of the review is dedicated to rogue waves in the oceans and to their laboratory counterpart with experiments performed in water basins. Most of the work and interpretation of the experimental results will be based on the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, an universal model, that rules the dynamics of weakly nonlinear, narrow band surface gravity waves. Then, we present examples of rogue waves occurring in different physical contexts and we discuss the related anomalous statistics of the wave amplitude, which deviates from the Gaussian behavior that were expected for random waves. The third part of the review is dedicated to optical rogue waves, with examples taken from the supercontinuum generation in photonic crystal fibers, laser fiber systems and two-dimensional spatiotemporal systems. In particular, the extreme waves observed in a two-dimensional spatially extended optical cavity allow us to introduce a description based on two essential conditions for the generation of rogue waves: nonlinear coupling and nonlocal coupling. The first requirement is needed in order to introduce an elementary size, such as that of the solitons or breathers, whereas the second requirement implies inhomogeneity, a mechanism needed to produce the events of mutual collisions and mutual amplification between the elementary solitons or wavepackets. The concepts of "granularity" and "inhomogeneity" as joint generators of optical rogue waves are introduced on the basis of a linear experiment. By extending these concepts to other systems, rogue waves can be classified as phenomena occurring in the presence of many uncorrelated "grains" of activity inhomogeneously distributed in large spatial domains, the "grains" being of linear or nonlinear origin, as in the case of wavepackets or solitons. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We show that, in contrast to the case without modulation, the Kuznetsov–Ma soliton develops multiple compression points whose number, shape and position are controlled both by the intensity of the modulation and by its frequency. In addition, when this modulation frequency is a rational multiple of the natural frequency of the Kuznetsov–Ma soliton, a scenario similar to a nonlinear resonance is obtained: in this case the spatial oscillations of the Kuznetsov-��Ma soliton's intensity are periodic. When the ratio of the two frequencies is irrational, the soliton's intensity is a quasiperiodic function. A striking and important result of our analysis is the possibility to suppress any component of the output spectrum of the Kuznetsov–Ma soliton by a judicious choice of the amplitude and frequency of the modulation.},

   abstract = {In optical fibres, weak modulations can grow at the expense of a strong pump to form a triangular comb of sideband pairs, until the process is reversed. Repeated cycles of such conversion and back-conversion constitute a manifestation of the universal nonlinear phenomenon known as Fermi-Pasta-Ulam recurrence. However, it remains a major challenge to observe the coexistence of different types of recurrences owing to the spontaneous symmetry-breaking nature of such a phenomenon. Here, we implement a novel non-destructive technique that allows the evolution in amplitude and phase of frequency modes to be reconstructed via post-processing of the fibre backscattered light. We clearly observe how control of the input modulation seed results in different recursive behaviours emerging from the phase-space structure dictated by the spontaneously broken symmetry. The proposed technique is an important tool to characterize other mixing processes and new regimes of rogue-wave formation and wave turbulence in fibre optics.},

For sufficiently strong variation, corresponding to the so-called strong dispersion management regime, the equation possesses pulse-like solutions which evolve nearly periodically. This phenomenon is explained by constructing ground states for the averaged variational principle and justifying the averaging procedure. Furthermore, it is shown that in certain critical cases (e.g. quintic nonlinearity in one dimension and cubic nonlinearity in two dimensions) the dispersion management technique stabilizes the pulses which otherwise would be unstable.

We demonstrate the concept experimentally by reporting observations of supervised transitions between waves with different genera. Considering the box problem in a focusing photorefractive medium, we tailor the time-dependent nonlinearity and dispersion to explore each region in the state diagram of the nonlinear wave propagation. Our result is the first realization of topological control of nonlinear waves. This new technique casts light on shock and rogue waves generation and can be extended to other nonlinear phenomena.},

Unlike most books on the subject, Feedback Systems develops transfer functions through the exponential response of a system, and is accessible across a range of disciplines that utilize feedback in physical, biological, information, and economic systems. Karl Åström and Richard Murray use techniques from physics, computer science, and operations research to introduce control-oriented modeling. They begin with state space tools for analysis and design, including stability of solutions, Lyapunov functions, reachability, state feedback observability, and estimators. The matrix exponential plays a central role in the analysis of linear control systems, allowing a concise development of many of the key concepts for this class of models. Åström and Murray then develop and explain tools in the frequency domain, including transfer functions, Nyquist analysis, PID control, frequency domain design, and robustness. They provide exercises at the end of every chapter, and an accompanying electronic solutions manual is available.

   abstract = {Synthesis The quickly expanding literature on early warning signals for critical transitions in ecosystems suggests that critical slowing down is a key phenomenon to measure the distance to a tipping point in ecosystems. Such work is broadly misinterpreted as showing that slowing down is specific to tipping points. In this contribution, we show why this is not the case. Early warning signals based on critical slowing down indicate a broader class of situations where a system becomes increasingly sensitive to perturbations. Ecosystem responses to external changes can surprise us by their abruptness and irreversibility. Models have helped identifying indicators of impending catastrophic shifts, referred to as 'generic early warning signals'. These indicators are linked to a phenomenon known as 'critical slowing down' which describes the fact that the recovery rate of a system after a perturbation decreases when the system approaches a bifurcation - such as the classical fold bifurcation associated to catastrophic shifts. However, contrary to what has sometimes been suggested in the literature, a decrease in recovery rate cannot be considered as specific to approaching catastrophic shifts. Here, we analyze the behavior of early warning signals based on critical slowing down in systems approaching a range of catastrophic and non-catastrophic situations. Our results show that slowing down generally happens in situations where a system is becoming increasingly sensitive to external perturbations, independently of whether the impeding change is catastrophic or not. These results highlight that indicators specific to catastrophic shifts are still lacking. More importantly, they also imply that in systems where we have no reason to expect catastrophic transitions, slowing down may still be used in a more general sense as a warning signal for a potential decrease in stability. © 2012 The Authors.},

They are the most universal form of soliton that can exist, and are seen in far-from-equilibrium systems in many fields, including chemistry, biology and physics. There has been particular interest in studying their properties in mode-locked lasers, but experiments have been limited by the inability to track the dynamical soliton evolution in real time. Here, we use simultaneous dispersive Fourier transform and time-lens measurements to completely characterize the spectral and temporal evolution of ultrashort dissipative solitons as their dynamics pass through a transient unstable regime with complex break-up and collisions before stabilization. Further insight is obtained from reconstruction of the soliton amplitude and phase and calculation of the corresponding complex-valued eigenvalue spectrum. These findings show how real-time measurements provide new insights into ultrafast transient dynamics in optics.},

   abstract = {Recent experimental and numerical studies of surface gravity waves propagating over a sloping bottom have shown that an increase in the probability of extreme waves can be triggered by depth variations in sufficiently shallow waters. This phenomenon is studied here by means of a boundary element method with fast multipole acceleration to solve the fully nonlinear water wave equations. We focus on the case of a random, unidirectional wave field with prescribed statistical properties propagating over a submerged slope and consider different depth variations, including a step. Validation is provided by comparing with experiments by Trulsen, Zeng, and Gramstad [Phys. Fluids 24, 097101 (2012)PHFLE61070-663110.1063/1.4748346]. Strongly non-Gaussian statistics are observed in a region localized near the depth transition, beyond which the statistics settle rapidly to the steady statistical state of finite-depth random wave fields. Using a harmonic separation technique, we show that the second-order terms are responsible for the change in the statistical properties near the depth transition. We explore in detail the effects of peak frequency, significant wave height, the inclination of the slope, and the depth of the shallower water side on the kurtosis, skewness, and the excess probability of the crest height, including their spatial distributions.},

   abstract = {The nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) is a seminal equation of nonlinear physics describing wave packet evolution in weakly-nonlinear dispersive media. The NLSE is especially important in understanding how high amplitude "rogue waves" emerge from noise through the process of modulation instability (MI) whereby a perturbation on an initial plane wave can evolve into strongly-localised "breather" or "soliton on finite background (SFB)" structures. Although there has been much study of such structures excited under controlled conditions, there remains the open question of how closely the analytic solutions of the NLSE actually model localised structures emerging in noise-seeded MI. We address this question here using numerical simulations to compare the properties of a large ensemble of emergent peaks in noise-seeded MI with the known analytic solutions of the NLSE. Our results show that both elementary breather and higher-order SFB structures are observed in chaotic MI, with the characteristics of the noise-induced peaks clustering closely around analytic NLSE predictions. A significant conclusion of our work is to suggest that the widely-held view that the Peregrine soliton forms a rogue wave prototype must be revisited. Rather, we confirm earlier suggestions that NLSE rogue waves are most appropriately identified as collisions between elementary SFB solutions.},

   abstract = {The formation mechanism of extreme waves in the coastal areas is still an open contemporary problem in fluid mechanics and ocean engineering. Previous studies have shown that the transition of water depth from a deeper to a shallower zone increases the occurrence probability of large waves. Indeed, more efforts are required to improve the understanding of extreme wave statistics variations in such conditions. To achieve this goal, large scale experiments of unidirectional irregular waves propagating over a variable bottom profile considering different transition water depths were performed. The validation of two highly nonlinear numerical models was performed for one representative case. The collected data were examined and interpreted by using spectral or bispectral analysis as well as statistical analysis. The higher probability of occurrence of large waves was confirmed by the statistical distributions built from the measured free surface elevation time series as well as by the local maximum values of skewness and kurtosis around the end of the slope. Strong second-order nonlinear effects were highlighted as waves propagate into the shallower region. A significant amount of wave energy was transmitted to low-frequency modes. Based on the experimental data, we conclude that the formation of extreme waves is mainly related to the second-order effect, which is also responsible for the generation of long waves. It is shown that higher-order nonlinearities are negligible in these sets of experiments. Several existing models for wave height distributions were compared and analysed. It appears that the generalised Boccotti's distribution can predict the exceedance of large wave heights with good confidence.},

For large returns, the distribution is exponential in log-returns with a time-dependent exponent, whereas for small returns it is Gaussian. For time lags longer than the relaxation time of variance, the probability distribution can be expressed in a scaling form using a Bessel function.

In particular, an increase of weather and climate extremes can lead to increased stress on human and natural systems, and a tendency for serious adverse effects. We rely on the EURO-CORDEX simulations and focus on the the screen-level daily mean temperature (T2m). We compare the shifting velocities of the cold and hot extremes with these of the associated central trends, i.e. the arithmetical mean or median. We define the extremes relative to the T2m distribution as it evolves with time over the period of 1951-2100. We find that temperature extremes shift at a similar velocity compared to that of the central trends. Accordingly, the T2m probability distribution shifts mostly as a whole, as the tails of the distribution increase together with the central trends. Exceptions occur however in specific regions and for the clustering of warm days, which shifts slower than all other extremes investigated in this study.},

   abstract = {This book was published in 2004. The Interaction of Ocean Waves and Wind describes in detail the two-way interaction between wind and ocean waves and shows how ocean waves affect weather forecasting on timescales of 5 to 90 days. Winds generate ocean waves, but at the same time airflow is modified due to the loss of energy and momentum to the waves; thus, momentum loss from the atmosphere to the ocean depends on the state of the waves. This volume discusses ocean wave evolution according to the energy balance equation. An extensive overview of nonlinear transfer is given, and as a by-product the role of four-wave interactions in the generation of extreme events, such as freak waves, is discussed. Effects on ocean circulation are described. Coupled ocean-wave, atmosphere modelling gives improved weather and wave forecasts. This volume will interest ocean wave modellers, physicists and applied mathematicians, and engineers interested in shipping and coastal protection.},

To some extent both of these statements are true; but only to some extent. While the core of the Python language is easy to lean and relatively simple (in part thanks to its consistency); the sheer richness of the language constructs and flexibility available can be overwhelming. In addition the Python environment, its eco system, the range of libraries available, the often competing options available etc., can make moving to the next level daunting. Once you have learned the core elements of the language such as how classes and inheritance work, how functions work, what are protocols and Abstract Base Classes etc.},

   abstract = {Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking’ were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history’. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

The dynamical behavior of these giant waves is here addressed as solutions of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation in both 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensions. We discuss analytical results for 1 + 1 dimensions and demonstrate numerically, for certain sets of initial conditions, the ubiquitous occurrence of rogue waves and holes in 2 + 1 spatial dimensions. A typical wave field evidently consists of a background of stable wave modes punctuated by the intermittent upthrusting of unstable rogue waves. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

The parameter bridges the wave steepness in deep water and Ursell's parameter in very shallow water, spanning the full range of water waves. Nonlinear properties of finite amplitude wave profiles are examined for the third order Stokes waves and the second order cnoidal waves. Relative crest elevations, the skewness and the ratio of wave height to root mean square surface elevation are expressed as unique functions of the new parameter. Laboratory data of regular waves in the range of relative water depth from 0.05 to 0.5 support the theoretical relationships between nonlinear properties and new parameter. Analysis of 128 wave records taken in coastal waters also supports these relationships. Nonlinear components of wave spectra are analyzed. Growth of nonlinear spectral components in intermediate depth to shallow water is governed by the new nonlinearity parameter. The mean wave period derived from spectrum, the spectral peakedness parameter, and the slope of wave spectrum in high frequency range all decrease as the value of nonlinearity parameter increases. The decreases are confirmed by the field data in coastal waters. (from author's abstract)},

The consequences of this vegetation-atmosphere feedback for the stability of the Amazon forest are still unclear. Here we show that the risk of self-amplified Amazon forest loss increases nonlinearly with dry-season intensification. We apply a novel complex-network approach, in which Amazon forest patches are linked by observation-based atmospheric water fluxes. Our results suggest that the risk of self-amplified forest loss is reduced with increasing heterogeneity in the response of forest patches to reduced rainfall. Under dry-season Amazonian rainfall reductions, comparable to Last Glacial Maximum conditions, additional forest loss due to self-amplified effects occurs in 10-13% of the Amazon basin.

   abstract = {A bimodal distribution of tropical tree cover at intermediate precipitation levels has been presented as evidence of fire-induced bistability. Here we subdivide satellite vegetation data into those from human-unaffected areas and those from regions close to human-cultivated zones. Bimodality is found to be almost absent in the unaffected regions, whereas it is significantly enhanced close to cultivated zones. Assuming higher logging rates closer to cultivated zones and spatial diffusion of fire, our spatiotemporal mathematical model reproduces these patterns. Given a gradient of climatic and edaphic factors, rather than bistability there is a predictable spatial boundary, a Maxwell point, that separates regions where forest and savanna states are naturally selected. While bimodality can hence be explained by anthropogenic edge effects and natural spatial heterogeneity, a narrow range of bimodality remaining in the human-unaffected data indicates that there is still bistability, although on smaller scales than claimed previously.},

Quantitative assessments for the maintenance of the tropical forest indicate that 'tipping points' may exist for total deforested area (>40%) and for global warming (ΔT > 3-4°C). The likelihood of exceeding a tipping point can be greatly exacerbated by increases in forest fires and droughts, but quantification of those effects is still lacking.

Before reaching the bifurcation point, the system gradually loses stability (‘critical slowing down’). Signals of critical slowing down may be detected through measurement of summary statistics, but how extrinsic and intrinsic noises influence statistical patterns prior to a transition is unclear. Here, we consider a range of stochastic models that exhibit transcritical, saddle-node and pitchfork bifurcations. Noise was assumed to be either intrinsic or extrinsic. We derived expressions for the stationary variance, autocorrelation and power spectrum for all cases. Trends in summary statistics signaling the approach of each bifurcation depend on the form of noise. For example, models with intrinsic stochasticity may predict an increase in or a decline in variance as the bifurcation parameter changes, whereas models with extrinsic noise applied additively predict an increase in variance. The ability to classify trends of summary statistics for a broad class of models enhances our understanding of how critical slowing down manifests in complex systems approaching a transition.},

   abstract = {In nature, many complex systems show the unexpected emergence of rare and extreme events that can have a huge impact on their surrounding environment. A well-known example comes from oceanography, in which large-amplitude rogue waves have been associated with many maritime disasters. The difficulty in understanding the physical origin of these waves has made them as much a part of folklore as of science 1-4. However, research into rogue waves has developed considerably since 2007, following the introduction of an analogy between the generation of large ocean waves and the pro pagation of light fields in optical fibres 5. This analogy was made based on the observation of long-tailed statistics in experiments that studied noise in fibre supercontinuum generation, and it attracted intense interest in both optics and hydrodynamics. Many subsequent studies have explored the analogous characteristics of the two systems in more detail, with the view of clarifying the potential role of nonlinear focusing effects during wave propagation 6-12. In optics, however, the term optical rogue wave has become widely applied to instabilities in a range of optical systems exhibiting long-tailed statistics, irrespective of the existence of a hydrodynamic analogy. In addition, the terminology rogue wave has become common, in a purely mathematical sense, to describe strongly localized solutions of certain nonlinear partial differential equations. Although nonlinear focusing has received most attention in hydrodynamic studies, the relative importance of linear and nonlinear effects in actually driving ocean rogue wave generation remains a subject of debate. A related discussion concerns the limita tions of 1D models when applied to the complex oceanic environment. In this Review, we provide an accessible overview of rogue waves in optics and hydrodynamics, the analogy between which was initially based on the suggested importance of nonlinear focusing in both domains. First, we introduce the main regime in which optical and hydrodynamic nonlinear wave propagation can be described by a common formalism. We then review results obtained in different optical and hydrodynamic systems, including results considered to have purely linear origins for rogue waves. Next, after reviewing optical phenomena that are potentially analogous to ocean wave propagation, we discuss particular cases (such as dissipative rogue waves in lasers) for which no such analogy is currently known. When considering water waves, we review studies of real-world ocean wave data and of wave-tank experiments in controlled environments. Nonlinear focusing Propagation models. In optics and hydrodynamics, the equations of wave propagation are simplified forms derived from Maxwell's equations and the Euler equations , respectively. In both cases, for unidirectional propagation and assuming that the underlying carrier waves are modulated by a slowly varying narrowband envelope, it is possible to derive a common mathematical formalism in the form of a nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) describing the evolution of the envelope in space and time 13-15. In optics, the NLSE applies to an envelope Rogue waves Large-amplitude waves satisfying the common definition that their height from trough to crest exceeds twice the significant wave height. In optics, the definition is the same, but expressed in terms of optical intensity. Abstract | Over a decade ago, an analogy was drawn between the generation of large ocean waves and the propagation of light fields in optical fibres. This analogy drove numerous experimental studies in both systems, which we review here. In optics, we focus on results arising from the use of real-time measurement techniques, whereas in oceanography we consider insights obtained from analysis of real-world ocean wave data and controlled experiments in wave tanks. This Review of the work in hydrodynamics includes results that support both nonlinear and linear interpretations of rogue wave formation in the ocean, and in optics, we also provide an overview of the emerging area of research applying the measurement techniques developed for the study of rogue waves to dissipative soliton systems. We discuss the insights gained from the analogy between the two systems and its limitations in modelling real-world ocean wave scenarios that include physical effects that go beyond a one-dimensional propagation model.},

Likewise, experimental studies have shown that stable wavetrains traveling against adverse currents can give rise to extreme waves. We studied this phenomenon by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools, whereby the non-hydrostatic Euler equations were solved utilizing the finite volume method. Waveforms based on a JONSWAP spectrum were generated in a numerical wave tank and were made to travel against current gradients of known strength, and wave characteristics were monitored in the process. We verified that waves gain energy from the underlying flow field as they travel against current gradients, and the simulated level of energy increase was comparable to that predicted by earlier studies of the NLS equation. The computed significant wave height, Hs, increased substantially, and there were strong indications that the current gradients induced nonlinear wave instabilities. The simulations were used to determine a new empirical relationship that correlates changes in the current velocity to changes in the Benjamin-Feir Index (BFI). The empirical relationship allows for seafaring entities to predict increased risk of rogue waves ahead, based on wave and current conditions.},

In addition, critical transitions (one from a high to a low species density and the other from a low to a high species density) are identified at different magnitudes in the presence of stochastic fluctuations. We also explore the robustness of critical slowing-down indicators, e.g., lag-1 autocorrelation and variance, to forewarn the critical transition in the metacommunity model. Further, a network structure also identifies synchronization and multiclustering for a different choice of initial conditions.

   abstract = {In the framework of the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation we study numerically the nonlinear stage of the modulation instability (MI) of the condensate. The development of the MI leads to the formation of 'integrable turbulence' (Zakharov 2009 Stud. Appl. Math. 122 219-34). We study the time evolution of its major characteristics averaged across realizations of initial data - the condensate solution seeded by small random noise with fixed statistical properties. We observe that the system asymptotically approaches to the stationary integrable turbulence, however this is a long process. During this process momenta, as well as kinetic and potential energies, oscillate around their asymptotic values. The amplitudes of these oscillations decay with time t as t-3/2, the phases contain the nonlinear phase shift that decays as t-1/2, and the frequency of the oscillations is equal to the double maximum growth rate of the MI. The evolution of wave-action spectrum is also oscillatory, and characterized by formation of the power-law region ∼|k|-α in the small vicinity of the zeroth harmonic k = 0 with exponent α close to 2/3. The corresponding modes form 'quasi-condensate', that acquires very significant wave action and macroscopic potential energy. The probability density function of wave amplitudes asymptotically approaches the Rayleigh distribution in an oscillatory way. Nevertheless, in the beginning of the nonlinear stage the MI slightly increases the occurrence of rogue waves. This takes place at the moments of potential energy modulus minima, where the PDF acquires 'fat tales' and the probability of rogue waves occurrence is by about two times larger than in the asymptotic stationary state. Presented facts need a theoretical explanation.},

   abstract = {For the design of safe and economic offshore structures and ships the knowledge of the extreme wave environment and related wave/structure interactions is required. A stochastic analysis of these phenomena is insufficient as local characteristics in the wave pattern are of great importance for deriving appropriate design criteria. This paper describes techniques to synthesize deterministic task-related 'rogue' waves or critical wave groups for engineering applications. These extreme events, represented by local characteristics like tailored design wave sequences, are integrated in a random or deterministic seaway with a defined energy density spectrum. If a strictly deterministic process is established, cause and effect are clearly related: At any position the nonlinear surface elevation and the associated pressure field as well as the velocity and acceleration fields can be determined. Also the point of wave/structure interaction can be selected arbitrarily, and any test can be repeated deliberately. Wave-structure interaction is decomposable into subsequent steps: Surface elevation, wave kinematics and dynamics, forces on structure components and the entire structure and structure motions. Firstly, the generation of linear wave groups is presented. The method is based on the wave focussing technique. In our approach the synthesis and up-stream transformation of arbitrary wave packets is developed from its so-called concentration point where all component waves are superimposed without phase-shift. For a target Fourier wave spectrum a tailored wave sequence can be assigned to a selected position. This wave train is linearly transformed back to the wave maker and - by introducing the electro-hydraulic and hydrodynamic transfer functions of the wave generator - the associated control signal is calculated. The generation of steeper and higher wave groups requires a more sophisticated approach as propagation velocity increases with wave height. With a semi-empirical procedure the control signal of extremely high wave groups is determined, and the propagation of the associated wave train is calculated by iterative integration of coupled equations of particle tracks. With this deterministic technique 'freak' waves up to heights of 3.2 m have been generated in a wave tank. For many applications the detailed knowledge of the nonlinear characteristics of the flow field is required, i.e. wave elevation, pressure field as well as velocity and acceleration fields. Using a finite element method the velocity potential is determined, which satisfies the Laplace equation for Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In general, extremely high rogue waves or critical wave groups are rare events embedded in a random seaway. The most efficient and economical procedure to simulate and generate such a specified wave scenario for a given design variance spectrum is based on the appropriate superposition of component waves or wavelets. As the method is linear, the wave train can be transformed down-stream and up-stream between wave board and target position. The desired characteristics like wave height and period as well as crest height and steepness are defined by an appropriate objective function. The subsequent optimization of the initially random phase spectrum is solved by a sequential quadratic programming method (SQP). The linear synthetization of critical wave events is expanded to a fully nonlinear simulation by applying the subplex method. Improving the linear SQP-solution by the nonlinear subplex expansion results in realistic rogue-waves embedded in random seas. As an illustration of this technique a reported rogue wave - the Draupner 'New Year Wave' is simulated and generated in a physical wave tank. Also a 'Three Sisters' wave sequence with succeeding wave heights Hs,...,2Hs,...,Hs, embedded in an extreme sea, is synthesized. For investigating the consequences of specific extreme sea conditions this paper analyses extreme roll motions and the capsizing of a RO - RO vessel in a severe storm wave group. In addition, the seakeeping behaviour of a semi-submersible in the Draupner New Year Wave, embedded in extreme irregular seas is numerically and experimentally evaluated. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully.

The existence is predicted of eigensolutions propagating unchanged along the fiber, which may be either spatially stable or spatially unstable, depending on the total power and the propagation-constant mismatch. The presence of spatially unstable eigensolutions dramatically affects the power exchange among the three waves. The physical implications of this instability for the frequency-conversion process, as well as its potential application to all-optical switching, are discussed.},

   abstract = {The field of nonlinear dispersive waves has developed enormously since the work of Stokes, Boussinesq, and Korteweg and de Vries (KdV) in the nineteenth century. In the 1960s researchers developed effective asymptotic methods for deriving nonlinear wave equations, such as the KdV equation, governing a broad class of physical phenomena. These equations admit special solutions including those commonly known as solitons. This book describes the underlying approximation techniques and methods for finding solutions to these and other equations, such as the nonlinear Schrödinger, sine–Gordon, Kadomtsev–Petviashvili and Burgers equations. The concepts and methods covered include wave dispersion, asymptotic analysis, perturbation theory, the method of multiple scales, deep and shallow water waves, nonlinear optics including fiber optic communications, mode-locked lasers and dispersion-managed wave phenomena. Most chapters feature exercise sets, making the book suitable for advanced courses or for self-directed learning. Graduate students and researchers will find this an excellent entry to a thriving area at the intersection of applied mathematics, engineering and physical science.},

It is shown that the adiabatically slow pumping (the time scale of forcing is much longer than the nonlinear time scale) results in selective enhancement of the solitary part of the wave ensemble. The slow forcing provides eventually wider wavenumber spectra, larger values of kurtosis and higher probability of large waves. In the opposite case of rapid forcing the nonlinear waves readjust passing through the stage of fast surges of statistical characteristics. Single forced envelope solitons are considered with the purpose to better identify the role of coherent wave groups. An approximate description on the basis of solutions of the integrable NLS equation is provided. Applicability of the Benjamin–Feir Index to forecasting of conditions favourable for rogue waves is discussed.},

   abstract = {Rogue waves is the name given by oceanographers to isolated large amplitude waves, that occur more frequently than expected for normal, Gaussian distributed, statistical events. Rogue waves are ubiquitous in nature and appear in a variety of different contexts. Besides water waves, they have been recently reported in liquid Helium, in nonlinear optics, microwave cavities, etc. The first part of the review is dedicated to rogue waves in the oceans and to their laboratory counterpart with experiments performed in water basins. Most of the work and interpretation of the experimental results will be based on the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, an universal model, that rules the dynamics of weakly nonlinear, narrow band surface gravity waves. Then, we present examples of rogue waves occurring in different physical contexts and we discuss the related anomalous statistics of the wave amplitude, which deviates from the Gaussian behavior that were expected for random waves. The third part of the review is dedicated to optical rogue waves, with examples taken from the supercontinuum generation in photonic crystal fibers, laser fiber systems and two-dimensional spatiotemporal systems. In particular, the extreme waves observed in a two-dimensional spatially extended optical cavity allow us to introduce a description based on two essential conditions for the generation of rogue waves: nonlinear coupling and nonlocal coupling. The first requirement is needed in order to introduce an elementary size, such as that of the solitons or breathers, whereas the second requirement implies inhomogeneity, a mechanism needed to produce the events of mutual collisions and mutual amplification between the elementary solitons or wavepackets. The concepts of “granularity” and “inhomogeneity” as joint generators of optical rogue waves are introduced on the basis of a linear experiment. By extending these concepts to other systems, rogue waves can be classified as phenomena occurring in the presence of many uncorrelated “grains” of activity inhomogeneously distributed in large spatial domains, the “grains” being of linear or nonlinear origin, as in the case of wavepackets or solitons.},

   abstract = {A review of physical mechanisms of the rogue wave phenomenon is given. The data of marine observations as well as laboratory experiments are briefly discussed. They demonstrate that freak waves may appear in deep and shallow waters. Simple statistical analysis of the rogue wave probability based on the assumption of a Gaussian wave field is reproduced. In the context of water wave theories the probabilistic approach shows that numerical simulations of freak waves should be made for very long times on large spatial domains and large number of realizations. As linear models of freak waves the following mechanisms are considered: dispersion enhancement of transient wave groups, geometrical focusing in basins of variable depth, and wave-current interaction. Taking into account nonlinearity of the water waves, these mechanisms remain valid but should be modified. Also, the influence of the nonlinear modulational instability (Benjamin–Feir instability) on the rogue wave occurence is discussed. Specific numerical simulations were performed in the framework of classical nonlinear evolution equations: the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, the Davey–Stewartson system, the Korteweg–de Vries equation, the Kadomtsev–Petviashvili equation, the Zakharov equation, and the fully nonlinear potential equations. Their results show the main features of the physical mechanisms of rogue wave phenomenon.},

The interaction between the chirped wave packet and wind is described by the Miles' mechanism. The differences between both approaches are discussed, and the influence of nonlinearity is emphasized. Furthermore, a different mechanism is considered, described by the modified Jeffreys' sheltering theory.

The evolution of β is plotted, for several values of the dispersion parameter <i>kh</i> with <i>k</i> the wave number. For constant depths we find that no matter what the values of wind velocities are, at small enough wave age the β-Miles linear growth rates are in the known deep-water limit. However winds of moderate intensities prevent the waves from growing beyond a critical wave age, which is also constrained by the water depth and is less than the wave age limit of deep water. Depending on wave age and wind velocity, the Jeffreys and Miles mechanisms are compared to determine which of them dominates. A wind-forced nonlinear Schrödinger equation is derived and the Akhmediev, Peregrine and Kuznetsov–Ma breather solutions for weak wind inputs in finite depth <i>h</i> are obtained.</p></p>},

For these experiments, a combined particle image velocimetry (PIV) and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique was developed. Two-dimensional airflow velocity fields were obtained as low as 100 μm above the air–water interface. Temporal and spatial wave field characteristics were also obtained. When the wind stress is too weak to generate surface waves, the mean velocity profile follows the law of the wall.

   abstract = {In this paper, we revisit Janssen's (J. Phys. Oceanogr., vol. 33 (4), 2003, pp. 863-884) formulation for the dynamic excess kurtosis of weakly nonlinear gravity waves in deep water. For narrowband directional spectra, the formulation is given by a sixfold integral that depends upon the Benjamin-Feir index and the parameter R D = σ2Θ =2ν2, a measure of short-crestedness for the dominant waves, with ν and σΘ denoting spectral bandwidth and angular spreading. Our refinement leads to a new analytical solution for the dynamic kurtosis of narrowband directional waves described with a Gaussian-type spectrum. For multidirectional or short-crested seas initially homogeneous and Gaussian, in a focusing (defocusing) regime dynamic kurtosis grows initially, attaining a positive maximum (negative minimum) at the intrinsic time scale τc ν2ω0tc 1=√3R, or tc=T0 ≈ 0.13/νσΘ , where ω0 2π=T0 denotes the dominant angular frequency. Eventually the dynamic excess kurtosis tends monotonically to zero as the wave field reaches a quasi-equilibrium state characterized by nonlinearities mainly due to bound harmonics. Quasi-resonant interactions are dominant only in unidirectional or long-crested seas where the longer-time dynamic kurtosis can be larger than that induced by bound harmonics, especially as the Benjamin-Feir index increases. Finally, we discuss the implication of these results for the prediction of rogue waves.},

   abstract = {Theoretical studies on linear shear instabilities often use simple velocity and density profiles (e.g., constant, piecewise) for obtaining good qualitative and quantitative predictions of the initial disturbances. Furthermore, such simple profiles provide a minimal model for obtaining a mechanistic understanding of otherwise elusive shear instabilities. However, except a few specific cases, the efficacy of simple profiles has remained limited to the linear stability paradigm. In this work, we have proposed a general framework that can simulate the fully nonlinear evolution of a variety of stratified shear instabilities as well as wave-wave and wave-topography interaction problems having simple piecewise constant and/or linear profiles. To this effect, we have modified the classical vortex method by extending the Birkhoff-Rott equation to multiple interfaces and, furthermore, have incorporated background shear across a density interface. The latter is more subtle and originates from the understanding that ...},

The theory of Miles (1957, 1959) and Benjamin (1959) on shear flows past a wavy boundary predicts a phase shift between the pressure distribution along the boundary and the boundary itself. An experimental verification of this theory is sought especially. A wind–wave facility 115 ft. long, 6 ft. high and 3 ft. wide was used. The facility is equipped with an oscil-lating-plate wave-generator which is capable of generating sinusoidal or arbitrary wave-forms, and a suction fan which can produce wind velocities up to 80 ft./sec when the water is at a nominal depth of 3 ft. The pressure sensor used for the measurements of pressure, was mounted on an oscillating device such that the sensor could be maintained at a fixed small distance (within 1/4 in.) above a propagating wavy surface at all times. The perturbation pressure over progressive waves is extracted from recorded data sensed by the moving sensor.

A Navier–Stokes solver is combined with the Smagorinsky subgrid-scale stress model and volume of fluid (VOF) air–water interface capturing scheme. Model predictions compare well with the experimental data with and without wind. It was found that the following and opposing winds shift the focus point downstream and upstream, respectively. The shift of focus point is mainly due to the action of wind-driven current instead of direct wind forcing. Under strong following/opposing wind forcing, there appears a slight increase/decrease of the extreme wave height at the focus point and an asymmetric/symmetric behavior in the wave focusing and defocusing processes. Under a weak following wind, however, the extreme wave height decreases with increasing wind speed because of the dominant effect of the wind-driven current over direct wind forcing.

A depth-dependent wave growth rate is derived from the dispersion relation of the wind/water interface. A suitable dimensionless finite depth wave age parameter allows us to plot a family of wave growth curves, each family member characterized by the water depth. Two major results are that for small wave age, the wave growth rates are comparable to those of deep water and for large wave age, a finite-depth wave-age-limited growth is reached, with wave growth rates going to zero. The corresponding limiting wave length and limiting phase speed are explicitely calculated in the shallow and in the deep water cases. A qualitative agreement with well-known empirical results is established and shows the robust consistency of the linear theoretical approach.},

These winds are associated with the pressure perturbations and transient mesoscale pressure gradients occurring in many gravity waves and wake lows. However, not all wake lows and gravity waves produce significant winds nor wind damage. In this paper, the factors that affect the surface winds produced by ducted gravity waves and wake lows are reviewed and examined. It is shown theoretically that the factors most conducive to high surface winds include a large-amplitude pressure disturbance, a slow intrinsic speed of propagation, and an ambient wind with the same sign as the pressure perturbation (i.e., a headwind for a pressure trough). Multiple case studies are presented, contrasting gravity waves and wake lows with varying amplitudes, intrinsic speeds, and background winds. In some cases high winds occurred, while in others they did not. In each case, the factor(...},

There were multiple wars and unrest, social and political transitions, technological innovation and widespread development that impacted every corner of the earth. In order to assess the sustainability implications of these changes, we conducted a study of three advanced nations particularly affected during this time: France, Germany and the United States (USA). All three nation states withstood these changes and yet continued to thrive, which speaks to their resilience. However, we were interested in determining whether any of these countries underwent a regime shift during this period and if they did, whether there was advanced warning that transition was imminent. This study seeks to evaluate systemic trends in each country by exploring key variables that describe its condition over time. We use Fisher Information to assess changing conditions in the nation states based on trends in social, economic and environmental variables and employ Bayes Theorem as an objective means of determining whether declines in Fisher information provide early warning signals of critical transitions. Results indicate that while the United States was relatively stable and France experienced a great deal of change during this period, only Germany appeared to undergo a regime shift. Further, each country exhibited decreasing Fisher information when approaching significant events (e.g., World Wars, Great Depression), and reflected unique mechanisms linked to dynamic changes in each nation state. This study highlights the potential of using trends in Fisher information as a sentinel for evaluating dynamic change and assessing resilience in coupled human and natural systems.},

   abstract = {The understanding of freak wave generation mechanisms has advanced and the community has reached a consensus that spectral geometry plays an important role. Numerous marine accident cases were studied and revealed that the narrowing of the directional spectrum is a good indicator of dangerous sea. However, the estimation of the directional spectrum depends on the performance of the third-generation wave model. In this work, a well-studied marine accident case in Japan in 1980 (Onomichi-Maruincident) is revisited and the sea states are hindcasted using both the DIA (discrete interaction approximation) and SRIAM (Simplified Research Institute of Applied Mechanics) nonlinear source terms. The result indicates that the temporal evolution of the basic parameters (directional spreading and frequency bandwidth) agree reasonably well between the two schemes and therefore the most commonly used DIA method is qualitatively sufficient to predict freakish sea state. The analyses revealed that in the case ofOnomichi-Maru, a moving gale system caused the spectrum to grow in energy with limited downshifting at the accident's site. This conclusion contradicts the marine inquiry report speculating that the two swell systems crossed at the accident's site. The unimodal wave system grew under strong influence of local wind with a peculiar energy transfer. © Author(s) 2014. CC Attribution 3.0 License.},

Recent studies demonstrate that several indicators based on changes in ecological time series can indicate that the system is approaching an impending transition. An exciting question is, however, whether we can predict more characteristics of the future system stability using measurements taken away from the transition. We address this question by introducing a model-less forecasting method to forecast catastrophic transition of an experimental ecological system. The experiment is based on the dynamics of a yeast population, which is known to exhibit a catastrophic transition as the environment deteriorates. By measuring the system’s response to perturbations prior to transition, we forecast the distance to the upcoming transition, the type of the transition (i.e., catastrophic/non-catastrophic) and the future equilibrium points within a range near the transition. Experimental results suggest a strong potential for practical applicability of this approach for ecological systems which are at risk of catastrophic transitions, where there is a pressing need for information about upcoming thresholds.},

We observe a phase transition at incident beam intensities of 0.4~TW/cm$^2$, where the interaction between filaments induce solid-like 2-dimensional crystals with a 2.7 mm lattice constant, independent of the initial beam diameter. Below 0.4~TW/cm$^2$, we evidence a mixed phase state in which some filaments are closely packed in localized clusters, nucleated on inhomogeneities (seeds) in the transverse intensity profile of the beam, and other are sparse with almost no interaction with their neighbors, similar to a gas. This analogy with a thermodynamic gas-solid phase transition is confirmed by calculating the interaction Hamiltonian between neighboring filaments, which takes into account the effect of diffraction, Kerr self-focusing and plasma generation. The shape of the effective potential is close to a Morse potential with an equilibrium bond length close to the observed value.},

One popular approach is the search for early warning signals (EWSs) based on alternative stable states theory. In this review, we cover the theory behind nonlinearity in dynamic systems and techniques to detect the loss of resilience that can indicate state transitions. We describe the research done on generic abundance‐based signals of instability that are derived from the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which represent the genesis of EWSs research. We highlight some of the issues facing the detection of such signals in biological systems – which are inherently complex and show low signal‐to‐noise ratios. We then document research on alternative signals of instability, including measuring shifts in spatial autocorrelation and trait dynamics, and discuss potential future directions for EWSs research based on detailed demographic and phenotypic data. We set EWSs research in the greater field of predictive ecology and weigh up the costs and benefits of simplicity vs. complexity in predictive models, and how the available data should steer the development of future methods. Finally, we identify some key unanswered questions that, if solved, could improve the applicability of these methods.},

   abstract = {When a complex dynamical system is externally disturbed, the statistical moments of signals associated to it can be affected in ways that depend on the nature and amplitude of the perturbation. In systems that exhibit phase transitions, the statistical moments can be used as Early Warnings (EW) of the transition. A natural question is thus to wonder what effect external disturbances have on the EWs of system. In this work we study the impact of external noise added to the system on the EWs, with particular focus on understanding the importance of the amplitude and complexity of the noise. We do this by analyzing the EWs of two computational models related to biology: the Kuramoto model, which is a paradigm of synchronization for biological systems, and a cellular automaton model of cardiac dynamics which has been used as a model for atrial fibrillation. For each model we first characterize the EWs. Then, we introduce external noise of varying intensity and nature to observe what effect this has on the EWs. In both cases we find that the introduction of noise amplified the EWs, with more complex noise having a greater effect. This both offers a way to improve the chance of detection of EWs in real systems and suggests that natural variability in the real world does not have a detrimental effect on EWs, but the opposite. © 2017 García-Gudiño et al.

We observe the emergence of nonlinear localized structures that evolve on a stochastic wave background. Such a coexistence is expected by the integrable turbulence theory for the nonlinear Schr\{\"o\}dinger equation (NLSE), and we report the first experimental observation in the context of hydrodynamic waves. We characterize the formation, the properties and the dynamics of these nonlinear coherent structures (solitons and extreme events) within the incoherent wave background. The extreme events result from the strong steepening of wave train fronts, and their emergence occurs after roughly one nonlinear length scale of propagation (estimated from NLSE). Solitons arise when nonlinearity and dispersion are weak, and of the same order of magnitude as expected from NLSE. We characterize the statistical properties of this state. The number of solitons and extreme events is found to increase all along the propagation, the wave-field distribution has a heavy tail, and the surface elevation spectrum is found to scale as a frequency power-law with an exponent --4.5 $\pm$ 0.5. Most of these observations are compatible with the integrable turbulence theory for NLSE although some deviations (e.g. power-law spectrum, asymmetrical extreme events) result from effects proper to hydrodynamic waves.},

   abstract = {Modulation instability (MI), also known as Benjamin-Feir instability, is considered to be the self-modulation of the continuous 'envelope waves' (i.e. regular wave trains in the context of deep water, or plane waves in optics) in the presence of small periodic or irregular noisy perturbations [1]. Since the 1960s, the propagation of weakly nonlinear dispersive wave packets affected by MI has been theoretically studied and experimentally observed in various fields of physics such as water waves, plasmas, laser light, electrical lines and Bose-Einstein condensates [2-16]. Their dynamical evolution can be easily modeled using the one-dimensional focusing nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation [1-5]. The resulting dynamics consists of an initial linear stage and a subsequent nonlinear stage. For the former, a simplistic linear stability analysis can be applied; the effect of modulation instability is the result of interaction between a strong carrier harmonic wave ω 0 and weak amplitude sidebands ω ± Ω 0 , i.e. a degenerate four-wave mixing process. The linearization of the NLS equation allows us to identify the instability criterion for the wave system under study [9], whereby one can determine the frequency threshold and the initial growth rate of perturbations. A typical exponential growth of the sidebands during wave propagation depicts the amplification of the initial weak perturbation imposed on the harmonic wave. Such a linear approach of MI ceases to be valid as soon as the perturbation reaches a comparable size to the carrier wave. One may expect that the rapid amplification of the perturbation favors nonlinear four-wave mixing processes, thus extending the energy cascade towards higher-order sidebands. Indeed, the linear stage of MI precedes a more complex evolution of wave packets, usually associated with the emergence of highly localized wave structures, the so-called nonlinear stage of MI [17]. The latter has received renewed attention since exact pulsating solutions of the complete MI evolution have been linked to the dynamics of rogue waves [18-21].},

   abstract = {<p> Mathematicians and physicists have long been interested in the subject of water waves. The problems formulated in this subject can be considered fundamental, but many questions remain unanswered. For instance, a satisfactory analytic theory of such a common and important phenomenon as wave breaking has yet to be developed. Our knowledge of the formation of rogue waves is also fairly poor despite the many efforts devoted to this subject. One of the most important tasks of the theory of water waves is the construction of simplified mathematical models that are applicable to the description of these complex events under the assumption of weak nonlinearity. The Zakharov equation, as well as the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) and the Dysthe equation (which are actually its simplifications), are among them. In this article, we derive a new modification of the Zakharov equation based on the assumption of unidirectionality (the assumption that all waves propagate in the same direction). To derive the new equation, we use the Hamiltonian form of the Euler equation for an ideal fluid and perform a very specific canonical transformation. This transformation is possible due to the ‘miraculous’ cancellation of the non-trivial four-wave resonant interaction in the one-dimensional wave field. The obtained equation is remarkably simple. We call the equation the ‘super compact water wave equation’. This equation includes a nonlinear wave term (à la NLSE) together with an advection term that can describe the initial stage of wave breaking. The NLSE and the Dysthe equations (Dysthe <italic>Proc. R. Soc. Lond.</italic> A, vol. 369, 1979, pp. 105–114) can be easily derived from the super compact equation. This equation is also suitable for analytical studies as well as for numerical simulation. Moreover, this equation also allows one to derive a spatial version of the water wave equation that describes experiments in flumes and canals. </p>},

   abstract = {The modulation instability (MI) is a universal mechanism that is responsible for the disintegration of weakly nonlinear narrow-banded wave fields and the emergence of localized extreme events in dispersive media. The instability dynamics is naturally triggered, when unstable energy side-bands located around the main energy peak are excited and then follow an exponential growth law. As a consequence of four wave mixing effect, these primary side-bands generate an infinite number of additional side-bands, forming a triangular side-band cascade. After saturation, it is expected that the system experiences a return to initial conditions followed by a spectral recurrence dynamics. Much complex nonlinear wave field motion is expected, when the secondary or successive side-band pair that are created are also located in the finite instability gain range around the main carrier frequency peak. This latter process is referred to as higher-order MI. We report a numerical and experimental study that confirm observation of higher-order MI dynamics in water waves. Furthermore, we show that the presence of weak dissipation may counter-intuitively enhance wave focusing in the second recurrent cycle of wave amplification. The interdisciplinary weakly nonlinear approach in addressing the evolution of unstable nonlinear waves dynamics may find significant resonance in other nonlinear dispersive media in physics, such as optics, solids, superfluids and plasma.},

This physical interpretation relies on the fact that the vertical velocity field is slowly varying across the critical layer, whereas both the displacement and vorticity fields vary rapidly. Realizing this allows for the construction of a physically intuitive description of the critical layer vorticity perturbations that may be approximated by a simple vortex sheet model, the essence of the wind-wave instability can then be captured through the interaction of the critical layer vorticity with the surface gravity wave.

Thermal stability declined within hours in all systems following passage of Irene, and the magnitude of change was related to the volume of water falling on the lake and catchment relative to lake volume. Across systems, temperature change predicted the change in primary production, but changes in mixed-layer thickness did not affect metabolism. Instead, respiration became a driver of ecosystem metabolism that was decoupled from in-lake primary production, likely due to addition of terrestrially derived carbon. Regionally, energetic disturbance of thermal structure was shorter-lived than disturbance from inflows of terrestrial materials. Given predicted regional increases in intense rain events with climate change, the magnitude and longevity of ecological impacts of these storms will be greater in systems with large catchments relative to lake volume, particularly when significant material is available for transport from the catchment. This case illustrates the power of automated sensor networks and associated human networks in assessing both system response and the characteristics that mediate physical and ecological responses to extreme events.},

In both cases, waves characterised by a JONSWAP spectrum and random Fourier phases have been launched at the input of the experimental device. The quantitative comparison, based on an appropriate scaling of the two experiments, shows a very good agreement between the statistics in hydrodynamics and optics. Spontaneous emergence of heavy tails in the probability density function of the wave amplitude is observed in both systems. The results demonstrate the universal features of rogue waves and provide a fundamental and explicit bridge between two important fields of research.

   abstract = {1. Weather-related episodic events are typically unpredictable, and their duration is often short. Abiotic and biological responses are often missed in routine monitoring. These responses are, however, now of particular relevance given projected changes in extreme weather conditions.\r\n\r\n2. We present data from high-frequency monitoring stations from lakes in Europe, North America and Asia that illustrate two classes of abiotic effects of weather events: (i) generally short-lived effects of storms on lake thermal structure and (ii) the more prolonged effects of high rainfall events on dissolved organic matter levels and water clarity. We further relate these abiotic effects to changes in dissolved oxygen or in chlorophyll a levels.\r\n\r\n3. Three differing causes for weather-related decreases in surface dissolved oxygen levels were observed: (i) entrainment of anoxic water from depth, (ii) reduction in primary productivity and (iii) increased mineralisation of organic carbon delivered from the catchment.\r\n\r\n4. The duration of in-lake effects tended to be longer for events driven by weather conditions with a longer return period, that is, conditions that were relatively more severe and less frequent at a site. While the susceptibility of lakes to change was related in part to the severity of the meteorological drivers, the impacts also depended on site-specific factors in some cases.\r\n\r\n5. The availability of high-frequency data at these sites provided insight into the capacity of the lakes to absorb current and future pressures. Several of the changes we observed, including increases in carbon availability, decreases in photosynthetically active radiation and increased disturbance, have the capacity to shift lakes towards an increased degree of heterotrophy. The magnitude and direction of any such change will, however, also depend on the magnitude and direction of climate change for a given location and on lake and catchment characteristics.},

These fluctuations are described by large deviation functions, obtained by solving a dominant eigenvalue problem similar to the problem of finding the ground state energy of quantum systems. This analogy is used to explain the differences that exist between the fluctuations of equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes.

   abstract = {The stability properties of intermediate-order climate models are investigated by computing their Lyapunov exponents (LEs). The two models considered are PUMA (Portable University Model of the Atmosphere), a primitive-equation simple general circulation model, and MAOOAM (Modular Arbitrary-Order Ocean-Atmosphere Model), a quasi-geostrophic coupled ocean-atmosphere model on a beta-plane. We wish to to investigate the effect of the different levels of filtering on the instabilities and dynamics of the atmospheric flows. Moreover, we assess the impact of the oceanic coupling, the dissipation scheme and the resolution on the spectra of LEs. The PUMA Lyapunov spectrum is computed for two different values of the meridional temperature gradient defining the Newtonian forcing. The increase of the gradient gives rise to a higher baroclinicity and stronger instabilities, corresponding to a larger dimension of the unstable manifold and a larger first LE. The convergence rate of the rate functional for the large deviation law of the finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) is fast for all exponents, which can be interpreted as resulting from the absence of a clear-cut atmospheric time-scale separation in such a model. The MAOOAM spectra show that the dominant atmospheric instability is correctly represented even at low resolutions. However, the dynamics of the central manifold, which is mostly associated to the ocean dynamics, is not fully resolved because of its associated long time scales, even at intermediate orders. This paper highlights the need to investigate the natural variability of the atmosphere-ocean coupled dynamics by associating rate of growth and decay of perturbations to the physical modes described using the formalism of the covariant Lyapunov vectors and to consider long integrations in order to disentangle the dynamical processes occurring at all time scales.},

Analysis of both stationary wave fields and transient transport shows large deviations from Rayleigh's law for the wave height distribution, which can only partially be described by existing multiple-scattering theories. At high frequencies, the flow shows branching structures similar to those observed previously in stationary imaging of electron flow. Semiclassical simulations confirm that caustics in the ray dynamics are likely to be responsible for the observed structures. Particular conspicuous features observed in the stationary patterns are "hot spots" with intensities far beyond those expected in a random wave field. Reinterpreting the flow patterns as ocean waves in the presence of spatially varying currents or depth variations in the sea floor, the branches and hot spots lead to enhanced frequency of freak or rogue wave formation in these regions.},

We prove that such fluctuation paths are the time reversed trajectories of the relaxation paths for a corresponding dual dynamics, which are also within the framework of quasi-geostrophic Langevin dynamics. Cases with or without detailed balance are studied. We discuss a specific example for which the stationary measure displays either a second order (continuous) or a first order (discontinuous) phase transition and a tricritical point. In situations where a first order phase transition is observed, the dynamics are bistable. Then, the transition paths between two coexisting attractors are instantons (fluctuation paths from an attractor to a saddle), which are related to the relaxation paths of the corresponding dual dynamics. For this example, we show how one can analytically determine the instantons and compute the transition probabilities for rare transitions between two attractors.},

   abstract = {The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein's theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations.},

The application of the methods of statistical mechanics to the description of the motion of fluid particles, i.e. to the Lagrangian dynamics, has led to a new quantitative theory of intermittency in turbulent transport. The first analytical description of anomalous scaling laws in turbulence has been obtained. The underlying physical mechanism reveals the role of statistical integrals of motion in non-equilibrium systems. For turbulent transport, the statistical conservation laws are hidden in the evolution of groups of fluid particles and arise from the competition between the expansion of a group and the change of its geometry. By breaking the scale-invariance symmetry, the statistically conserved quantities lead to the observed anomalous scaling of transported fields. Lagrangian methods also shed new light on some practical issues, such as mixing and turbulent magnetic dynamo.},

Despite the fact that use of various asymptotic relations that are valid only for t → ∞ or integration with respect to time over a time scale much longer than O[period × (ak)−2] is necessary in the derivation of Hasselmann’s Snl, it is clearly demonstrated that the rate of change of the spectrum given by the numerical simulation agrees very well with Hasselmann’s Snl at every instance of ordinary time scale comparable to the period.

However the typical time scales underlying the random dynamics in those experiments prevented --up to now-- the direct observation of isolated RWs.

It is shown that one can use the incomplete information contained in this spectrum as prior and supplement this information with the MNLS dynamics to reliably estimate the probability distribution of the sea surface elevation far in the tail at later times. Our results indicate that rogue waves occur when the system hits unlikely pockets of wave configurations that trigger large disturbances of the surface height. The rogue wave precursors in these pockets are wave patterns of regular height but with a very specific shape that is identified explicitly, thereby allowing for early detection. The method proposed here combines Monte Carlo sampling with tools from large deviations theory that reduce the calculation of the most likely rogue wave precursors to an optimization problem that can be solved efficiently. This approach is transferable to other problems in which the system's governing equations contain random initial conditions and/or parameters.},

   abstract = {The multi-disciplinary field of fluid mechanics is one of the most actively developing fields of physics, mathematics and engineering. In this book, the fundamental ideas of fluid mechanics are presented from a physics perspective. Using examples taken from everyday life, from hydraulic jumps in a kitchen sink to Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities in clouds, the book provides readers with a better understanding of the world around them. It teaches the art of making fluid-mechanical estimates and shows how the ideas and methods developed to study the mechanics of fluids are used to analyze other systems with many degrees of freedom in statistical physics and field theory. Aimed at undergraduate and graduate students, the book assumes no prior knowl-edge of the subject and only a basic understanding of vector calculus and analysis. It contains 32 exercises of varying difficulty, from simple estimates to elaborate calculations, with detailed solutions to help readers understand fluid mechanics.

   abstract = {The data recorded in optical fiber [1] and in hydrodynamic [2] experiments reported the pioneering observation of nonlinear waves with spatiotemporal localization similar to the Peregrine soliton are examined by using nonlinear spectral analysis. Our approach is based on the integrable nature of the one-dimensional focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation (1D-NLSE) that governs at leading order the propagation of the optical and hydrodynamic waves in the two experiments. Nonlinear spectral analysis provides certain spectral portraits of the analyzed structures that are composed of bands lying in the complex plane. The spectral portraits can be interpreted within the framework of the so-called finite gap theory (or periodic inverse scattering transform). In particular, the number N of bands composing the nonlinear spectrum determines the genus g = N - 1 of the solution that can be viewed as a measure of complexity of the space-time evolution of the considered solution. Within this setting the ideal, rational Peregrine soliton represents a special, degenerate genus 2 solution. While the fitting procedures employed in [1] and [2] show that the experimentally observed structures are quite well approximated by the Peregrine solitons, nonlinear spectral analysis of the breathers observed both in the optical fiber and in the water tank experiments reveals that they exhibit spectral portraits associated with more general, genus 4 finite-gap NLSE solutions. Moreover, the nonlinear spectral analysis shows that the nonlinear spectrum of the breathers observed in the experiments slowly changes with the propagation distance, thus confirming the influence of unavoidable perturbative higher order effects or dissipation in the experiments.},

   abstract = {Caustics are natural phenomena in which nature concentrates the energy of waves. Although, they are known mostly in optics, caustics are intrinsic to all wave phenomena. For example, studies show that fluctuations in the profile of an ocean floor can generate random caustics and focus the energy of tsunami waves. Caustics share many similarities to rogue waves, as they both exhibit heavy-tailed distribution, i.e. an overpopulation of large events. Linear Schr\"odinger-type equations are usually used to explain the wave dynamics of caustics. However, in that the wave amplitude increases dramatically in caustics, nonlinearity is inevitable in many systems. In this Letter, we investigate the effect of nonlinearity on the formation of optical caustics. We show experimentally that, in contrast to linear systems, even small phase fluctuations can generate strong caustics upon nonlinear propagation. We simulated our experiment based on the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) with Kerr-type nonlinearity, which describes the wave dynamics not only in optics, but also in some other physical systems such as oceans. Therefore, our results may also aid our understanding of ocean phenomena.},

The ε-drawdowns (resp. ε-drawups) generalize the notion of runs of negative (resp. positive) returns so as to capture the risks to which investors are arguably the most concerned with. Similarly to the distribution of returns, we find that the distributions of ε-drawdowns and ε-drawups exhibit power law tails, albeit with exponents significantly larger than those for the return distributions. This paradoxical result can be attributed to (i) the existence of significant transient dependence between returns and (ii) the presence of large outliers (Dragon-Kings) characterizing the extreme tail of the drawdown/drawup distributions deviating from the power law. The study of the tail dependence between the sizes, speeds and durations of drawdown/drawup indicates a clear relationship between size and speed but none between size and duration. This implies that the most extreme drawdown/drawup tend to occur fast and are dominated by a few very large returns. We discuss both the endogenous and exogenous origins of these extreme events.},

Nowadays, the universal nature of MI is established through numerous observations in physics. However, even now, 50 years later, more practical but complex forms of this old physical phenomenon at the frontier of nonlinear wave theory have still not been revealed (i.e., when perturbations beyond simple harmonic are involved). Here, we report the evidence of the broadest class of creation and annihilation dynamics of MI, also called superregular breathers. Observations are done in two different branches of wave physics, namely, in optics and hydrodynamics. Based on the common framework of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, this multidisciplinary approach proves universality and reversibility of nonlinear wave formations from localized perturbations for drastically different spatial and temporal scales.},

   abstract = {We show that generalized extreme value statistics-the statistics of the kth largest value among a large set of random variables-can be mapped onto a problem of random sums. This allows us to identify classes of non-identical and (generally) correlated random variables with a sum distributed according to one of the three (k-dependent) asymptotic distributions of extreme value statistics, namely the Gumbel, Fréchet and Weibull distributions. These classes, as well as the limit distributions, are naturally extended to real values of k, thus providing a clear interpretation to the onset of Gumbel distributions with non-integer index k in the statistics of global observables. This is one of the very few known generalizations of the central limit theorem to non-independent random variables. Finally, in the context of a simple physical model, we relate the index k to the ratio of the correlation length to the system size, which remains finite in strongly correlated systems.},

   abstract = {The Benjamin-Feir instability is a modulational instability in which a uniform train of oscillatory waves of moderate amplitude loses energy to a small perturbation of other waves with nearly the same frequency and direction. The concept is well established in water waves, in plasmas and in optics. In each of these applications, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation is also well established as an approximate model based on the same assumptions as required for the derivation of the Benjamin-Feir theory: a narrow-banded spectrum of waves of moderate amplitude, propagating primarily in one direction in a dispersive medium with little or no dissipation. In this paper, we show that for waves with narrow bandwidth and moderate amplitude, any amount of dissipation (of a certain type) stabilizes the instability. We arrive at this stability result first by proving it rigorously for a damped version of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, and then by confirming our theoretical predictions with laboratory experiments on waves of moderate amplitude in deep water. The Benjamin-Feir instability is often cited as the first step in a nonlinear process that spreads energy from an initially narrow bandwidth to a broader bandwidth. In this process, sidebands grow exponentially until nonlinear interactions eventually bound their growth. In the presence of damping, this process might still occur, but our work identifies another possibility: damping can stop the growth of perturbations before nonlinear interactions become important. In this case, if the perturbations are small enough initially, then they never grow large enough for nonlinear interactions to become important.},

In our study that enters within the framework of integrable turbulence, we specifically focus on optical fiber systems accurately described by the integrable one-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation. We consider random complex fields having a Gaussian statistics and an infinite extension at initial stage. We use numerical simulations with periodic boundary conditions and optical fiber experiments to investigate spectral and statistical changes experienced by nonlinear waves in focusing and in defocusing propagation regimes. As a result of nonlinear propagation, the power spectrum of the random wave broadens and takes exponential wings both in focusing and in defocusing regimes. Heavy-tailed deviations from Gaussian statistics are observed in focusing regime while low-tailed deviations from Gaussian statistics are observed in defocusing regime. After some transient evolution, the wave system is found to exhibit a statistically stationary state in which neither the probability density function of the wave field nor the spectrum changes with the evolution variable. Separating fluctuations of small scale from fluctuations of large scale both in focusing and defocusing regimes, we reveal the phenomenon of intermittency; i.e., small scales are characterized by large heavy-tailed deviations from Gaussian statistics, while the large ones are almost Gaussian.},

   abstract = {Rogue waves is the name given by oceanographers to isolated large amplitude waves, that occur more frequently than expected for normal, Gaussian distributed, statistical events. Rogue waves are ubiquitous in nature and appear in a variety of different contexts. Besides water waves, they have been recently reported in liquid Helium, in nonlinear optics, microwave cavities, etc. The first part of the review is dedicated to rogue waves in the oceans and to their laboratory counterpart with experiments performed in water basins. Most of the work and interpretation of the experimental results will be based on the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, an universal model, that rules the dynamics of weakly nonlinear, narrow band surface gravity waves. Then, we present examples of rogue waves occurring in different physical contexts and we discuss the related anomalous statistics of the wave amplitude, which deviates from the Gaussian behavior that were expected for random waves. The third part of the review is dedicated to optical rogue waves, with examples taken from the supercontinuum generation in photonic crystal fibers, laser fiber systems and two-dimensional spatiotemporal systems. In particular, the extreme waves observed in a two-dimensional spatially extended optical cavity allow us to introduce a description based on two essential conditions for the generation of rogue waves: nonlinear coupling and nonlocal coupling. The first requirement is needed in order to introduce an elementary size, such as that of the solitons or breathers, whereas the second requirement implies inhomogeneity, a mechanism needed to produce the events of mutual collisions and mutual amplification between the elementary solitons or wavepackets. The concepts of "granularity" and "inhomogeneity" as joint generators of optical rogue waves are introduced on the basis of a linear experiment. By extending these concepts to other systems, rogue waves can be classified as phenomena occurring in the presence of many uncorrelated "grains" of activity inhomogeneously distributed in large spatial domains, the "grains" being of linear or nonlinear origin, as in the case of wavepackets or solitons. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Many natural systems can be represented by complex networks of dynamical units with modular structure in the form of communities of densely interconnected nodes. Unraveling this community structure from observed data requires the development of appropriate tools, particularly when the nodes are embedded in a regular space grid and the datasets are short and noisy. Here we propose two methods to identify communities, and validate them with the analysis of climate datasets recorded at a regular grid of geographical locations covering the Earth surface. By identifying mutual lags among time-series recorded at different grid points, and by applying symbolic time-series analysis, we are able to extract meaningful regional communities, which can be interpreted in terms of large-scale climate phenomena. The methods proposed here are valuable tools for the study of other systems represented by networks of dynamical units, allowing the identification of communities, through time-series analysis of the observed output signals. Many real-world complex systems can be represented in terms of networks of interacting nodes embedded in space. Examples include power grids, fiber-optic networks, road networks, flight connections, etc 1–3 . Such net-works are usually organized in modules or communities of densely interconnected nodes 4–11 . The spatial embed-ding of the network can hidden the underlying community structure, rendering the identification of communities a challenging a task 12–14 . The effects of space in the topology of the network are particularly important when the network is built with correlation analysis of output signals which are recorded at a regular grid of observation points. Examples of this situation include brain functional networks 15–17 and climate networks 18–22 . Here we focus on climate networks, which provide relevant insight into global climate phenomena 23–31 . Previous work has shown that climate communities reveal coherent subsystems 32 , can be used for model inter-comparisons 33 , and can advance climate predictability 34 . For example, communities obtained from the analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) reveal information about long-term SST variability 35 . In our approach, a climate community is understood as a set of geographical regions that share some common property (dynamical or statistical) of the climate in those regions. Therefore, our approach differs from (and is complementary to) that aimed at performing a dimensionality reduction. For example, the work by Runge et al. 36},

Intended for statisticians and non-statisticians alike, the theoretical treatment is elementary, with heuristics often replacing detailed mathematical proof. Most aspects of extreme modeling techniques are covered, including historical techniques (still widely used) and contemporary techniques based on point process models. A wide range of worked examples, using genuine datasets, illustrate the various modeling procedures and a concluding chapter provides a brief introduction to a number of more advanced topics, including Bayesian inference and spatial extremes. All the computations are carried out using S-PLUS, and the corresponding datasets and functions are available via the Internet for readers to recreate examples for themselves. An essential reference for students and researchers in statistics and disciplines such as engineering, finance and environmental science, this book will also appeal to practitioners looking for practical help in solving real problems.

Although considerable effort has been directed towards understanding the physics behind these mysterious and potentially destructive events, the complete picture remains uncertain. Furthermore, rogue waves have not yet been observed in other physical systems. Here, we introduce the concept of optical rogue waves, a counterpart of the infamous rare water waves. Using a new real-time detection technique, we study a system that exposes extremely steep, large waves as rare outcomes from an almost identically prepared initial population of waves. Specifically, we report the observation of rogue waves in an optical system, based on a microstructured optical fibre, near the threshold of soliton-fission supercontinuum generation--a noise-sensitive nonlinear process in which extremely broadband radiation is generated from a narrowband input. We model the generation of these rogue waves using the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation and demonstrate that they arise infrequently from initially smooth pulses owing to power transfer seeded by a small noise perturbation.},

We consider the case where this growth rate, normalised with respect to the frequency of the carrier wave, is of the order of the wave steepness. Using the method of multiple scales, we calculate the terms which appear in the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation in this regime of fast-growing waves. We define a coordinate transformation which maps the forced NLS equation into the standard NLS with constant coefficients, that has a number of known analytical soliton solutions. Among these solutions, the Peregrine and the Akhmediev solitons show an enhancement of both their lifetime and maximum amplitude which is in qualitative agreement with the results of tank experiments and numerical simulations of dispersive focusing under the action of wind. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The behaviour of the normal mode frequencies in the range 0.35 ak 0.43 is clarified. The family of frequency curves is bounded by the lowest superharmonic. It is verified that this mode becomes unstable when ak = 0.4292, corresponding to the lowest maximum of the energy density E.

   abstract = {A review of physical mechanisms of the rogue wave phenomenon is given. The data of marine observations as well as laboratory experiments are briefly discussed. They demonstrate that freak waves may appear in deep and shallow waters. Simple statistical analysis of the rogue wave probability based on the assumption of a Gaussian wave field is reproduced. In the context of water wave theories the probabilistic approach shows that numerical simulations of freak waves should be made for very long times on large spatial domains and large number of realizations. As linear models of freak waves the following mechanisms are considered: dispersion enhancement of transient wave groups, geometrical focusing in basins of variable depth, and wave-current interaction. Taking into account nonlinearity of the water waves, these mechanisms remain valid but should be modified. Also, the influence of the nonlinear modulational instability (Benjamin-Feir instability) on the rogue wave occurence is discussed. Specific numerical simulations were performed in the framework of classical nonlinear evolution equations: the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, the Davey-Stewartson system, the Korteweg-de Vries equation, the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, the Zakharov equation, and the fully nonlinear potential equations. Their results show the main features of the physical mechanisms of rogue wave phenomenon. © 2003 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We experimentally and numerically investigate the effect of wind forcing on the spectral dynamics of Akhmediev breathers, a wave-type known to model the modulation instability. We develop the wind model to the same order in wave steepness as the higher order modification of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, also referred to as the Dysthe equation. This results in an asymmetric wind term in the higher order, in addition to the leading order wind forcing term. The derived model is in good agreement with laboratory experiments within the range of the facility's length. We show that the leading order forcing term amplifies all frequencies equally and therefore induces only a broadening of the spectrum, while the asymmetric higher order term in the model enhances the higher frequencies more than the lower ones. Thus, the latter term induces a permanent upshift in the spectral mean. On the other hand, in contrast to the direct effect of wind forcing, wind can indirectly lead to frequency downshifts, due to dissipative effects such aswave breaking, or through the amplification of the intrinsic spectral asymmetry of the Dysthe equation. Furthermore, the definitions of the up- and downshift in terms of peak frequency and mean frequency, which are critical to relate our work to previous results, are highlighted and discussed.},

We demonstrate that the total correlations of the diagonal ensemble provides a meaningful diagnostic tool to pin-down, probe, and better understand the MBL transition and ergodicity breaking in quantum systems. In particular, we show that the total correlations has sub-linear dependence on the system size in delocalized, ergodic phases, whereas we find that it scales extensively in the localized phase developing a pronounced peak at the transition. We exemplify the power of our approach by means of an exact diagonalization study of a Heisenberg spin chain in a disordered field.},

   abstract = {The ideas of thermodynamics have proved fruitful in the setting of quantum information theory, in particular the notion that when the allowed transformations of a system are restricted, certain states of the system become useful resources with which one can prepare previously inaccessible states. The theory of entanglement is perhaps the best-known and most well-understood resource theory in this sense. Here we return to the basic questions of thermodynamics using the formalism of resource theories developed in quantum information theory and show that the free energy of thermodynamics emerges naturally from the resource theory of energy-preserving transformations. Specifically, the free energy quantifies the amount of useful work which can be extracted from asymptotically-many copies of a quantum system when using only reversible energy-preserving transformations and a thermal bath at fixed temperature. The free energy also quantifies the rate at which resource states can be reversibly interconverted asymptotically, provided that a sublinear amount of coherent superposition over energy levels is available, a situation analogous to the sublinear amount of classical communication required for entanglement dilution.},

@article{Gour2015,
   abstract = {We review recent work on the foundations of thermodynamics in the light of quantum information theory. We adopt a resource-theoretic perspective, wherein thermodynamics is formulated as a theory of what agents can achieve under a particular restriction, namely, that the only state preparations and transformations that they can implement for free are those that are thermal at some fixed temperature. States that are out of thermal equilibrium are the resources. We consider the special case of this theory wherein all systems have trivial Hamiltonians (that is, all of their energy levels are degenerate). In this case, the only free operations are those that add noise to the system (or implement a reversible evolution) and the only nonequilibrium states are states of informational nonequilibrium, that is, states that deviate from the maximally mixed state. The degree of this deviation we call the state's nonuniformity; it is the resource of interest here, the fuel that is consumed, for instance, in an erasure operation. We consider the different types of state conversion: exact and approximate, single-shot and asymptotic, catalytic and noncatalytic. In each case, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for the conversion to be possible for any pair of states, emphasizing a geometrical representation of the conditions in terms of Lorenz curves. We also review the problem of quantifying the nonuniformity of a state, in particular through the use of generalized entropies, and that of quantifying the gap between the nonuniformity one must expend to achieve a single-shot state preparation or state conversion and the nonuniformity one can extract in the reverse operation. Quantum state-conversion problems in this resource theory can be shown to be always reducible to their classical counterparts, so that there are no inherently quantum-mechanical features arising in such problems. This body of work also demonstrates that the standard formulation of the second law of thermodynamics is inadequate as a criterion for deciding whether or not a given state transition is possible.},

We introduce a novel perturbation theorem for physically relevant weak system-bath couplings that is applicable even in the thermodynamic limit. We identify conditions under which thermalization happens and discuss the underlying physics. Based on these results, we also present a fully general quantum algorithm for preparing Gibbs states on a quantum computer with a certified runtime and error bound. This complements quantum Metropolis algorithms, which are expected to be efficient but have no known runtime estimates and only work for local Hamiltonians.},

@article{Shannon1948,
   abstract = {The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

These properties, and especially the 31P and 183W nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, allowed us to propose the structure. It is a lacunary species that reacts with Co(II) to give two 1-1 complexes, probably coordination isomers. In the presence of Co(II) the A-type ->B-type PW9 isomerization occurs in several steps, which are specified. The tungstophosphate β isomers are less stable than the corresponding tungstosilicates or germanates, and β-PW12 was only identified as a reduced species PW12O404-.},

Using density functional theory, we reveal the mechanisms of mechanical failure of pure graphene under a generic state of tension at zero temperature. One failure mechanism is a novel soft-mode phonon instability of the K1 mode, whereby the graphene sheet undergoes a phase transition and is driven towards isolated hexagonal rings resulting in a reduction of strength. The other is the usual elastic instability corresponding to a maximum in the stress-strain curve. Our results indicate that finite wave vector soft modes can be the key factor in limiting the strength of monolayer materials.},

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by elucidating the phonon mechanism responsible for superconductivity in boron-doped diamond. Our calculated phonon self-energy and Eliashberg spectral function show that superconductivity cannot be explained without taking into account the finite-wave-vector Fourier components of the vibrational modes introduced by boron, as well as the breaking of the diamond crystal periodicity induced by doping.},

   abstract = {This article reviews the basic theoretical aspects of graphene, a one-atom-thick allotrope of carbon, with unusual two-dimensional Dirac-like electronic excitations. The Dirac electrons can be controlled by application of external electric and magnetic fields, or by altering sample geometry and/or topology. The Dirac electrons behave in unusual ways in tunneling, confinement, and the integer quantum Hall effect. The electronic properties of graphene stacks are discussed and vary with stacking order and number of layers. Edge (surface) states in graphene depend on the edge termination (zigzag or armchair) and affect the physical properties of nanoribbons. Different types of disorder modify the Dirac equation leading to unusual spectroscopic and transport properties. The effects of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in single layer and multilayer graphene are also presented.},

   abstract = {The interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) gene encodes a transcription factor that plays an important role in the innate as well as in the cell-mediated immune responses. The IRF5 gene has been shown to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. We studied whether the IRF5 gene is also associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Twelve polymorphisms in the IRF5 gene were genotyped in a cohort of 1007 IBD patients (748 CD and 254 UC) and 241 controls from Wallonia, Belgium. The same polymorphisms were genotyped in a confirmatory cohort of 311 controls and 687 IBD patients (488 CD and 192 UC) from Leuven, Belgium. A strong signal of association P = 1.9 x 10(-5), odds ratio (OR) 1.81 (1.37-2.39) with IBD was observed for a 5 bp indel (CGGGG) polymorphism in the promoter region of the IRF5 gene. The association was detectable also in CD patients (P = 6.8 x 10(-4)) and was particularly strong among the UC patients P = 5.3 x 10(-8), OR = 2.42 (1.76-3.34). The association of the CGGGG indel was confirmed in the second cohort P = 3.2 x 10(-5), OR = 1.59 (1.28-1.98). The insertion of one CGGGG unit is predicted to create an additional binding site for the transcription factor SP1. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we show allele-specific differences in protein binding to this repetitive DNA-stretch, which suggest a potential function role for the CGGGG indel.},

Ferromagnetism in such a material is not directly evident as it is inherently composed of only nonmagnetic constituents. Our results nevertheless show strong ferromagnetism with a saturation of 0.9μ(B)/hexagon projected area, which cannot be explained by simple magnetic impurities. The ferromagnetism is unique to hydrogenated epitaxial graphene on SiC, where interactions with the interfacial buffer layer play a crucial role. We argue that the origin of the observed ferromagnetism is governed by electron correlation effects of the narrow Si dangling bond states in the buffer layer exchange coupled to localized states in the hydrogenated graphene layer. This forms a quasi-three-dimensional ferromagnet with a Curie temperature higher than 300 K.},

   abstract = {By considering analytical expressions for the self-energies of intervalley and intravalley phonons in graphene, we describe the behavior of D, 2D, and D′ Raman bands with changes in doping (μ) and light-excitation energy (EL). Comparing the self-energy with the observed μ dependence of the 2D bandwidth, we estimate the wave vector q of the constituent intervalley phonon at ℏvq≃EL/1.6 (v is the electron's Fermi velocity) and conclude that the self-energy makes a major contribution (60%) to the dispersive behavior of the D and 2D bands. The estimate of q is based on a concept of shifted Dirac cones in which the resonance decay of a phonon satisfying q>ω/v (ω is the phonon frequency) into an electron-hole pair is suppressed when μ<(ℏvq−ℏω)/2. We highlight the fact that the decay of an intervalley (and intravalley longitudinal optical) phonon with q=ω/v is strongly suppressed by electron-phonon coupling at an arbitrary μ. This feature is in contrast with the divergent behavior of an intravalley transverse optical phonon, which bears a close similarity to the polarization function relevant to plasmons.},

The mechanism for the rogue wave formation lies in the interplay of stochastic processes with multistable deterministic dynamics. Low-frequency noise applied to a diode pump current induces rare jumps to coexisting subharmonic states with high-amplitude pulses perceived as rogue waves. The probability of these events depends on the noise filtered frequency and grows up when the noise amplitude increases. The probability distribution of spike amplitudes confirms the rogue wave character of the observed phenomenon. The results of numerical simulations are in good agreement with experiments. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

While the velocity field shows self-similarity over many different length scales, the energy spectrum, E(k), deviates strongly from the k -5/3 law, which is predicted for the energy inverse cascade in two dimensions. Our experimental data can be satisfactorily fit to k-3 over a range of wave numbers that are smaller than the wave number kinj, at which the energy is injected into the system.},

   abstract = {A mathematical model is constructed to describe the two-dimensional flow in a vertical soap film that is draining under gravity. An asymptotic analysis is employed that uses the long-wave or "lubrication" approximation. The modeling results in three coupled partial differential equations that include a number of dimensionless input parameters. The equations are solved numerically. The three functions calculated, as they vary in space and time, are the film thickness, the surface concentration of an assumed insoluble surfactant, and the slip or surface velocity. The film is assumed to be supported by "wire frame" elements at both the top and the bottom; thus the liquid area and the total surfactant are conserved in the simulation. A two-term "disjoining" pressure is included in the model that allows the development of thin, stable, i.e., "black," films. While the model uses a simplified picture of the relevant physics, it appears to capture observed soap film shape evolution over a large range of surfactant concentrations. The model predicts that, depending on the amount of surfactant that is present, the film profile will pass through several distinct phases. These are (i) rapid initial draining with surfactant transport, (ii) slower draining with an almost immobile interface due to the surface tension gradient effect, and (iii) eventual formation of black spots at various locations on the film. This work is relevant to basic questions concerning surfactant efficacy, as well as to specific questions concerning film and foam draining due to gravity. Prospects for extension to three-dimensional soap film flows are also considered. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.},

   abstract = {The effect of elasticity on the meniscus shape and film thickness for the free boundary creeping flow created by injecting air to a Hele-Shaw cell initially filled with a viscoelastic fluid is studied theoretically. The theory is developed with the assumptions that the displaced viscoelastic fluid wets the walls and that capillary number Ca and the local Weissenberg number We are both small. The transition region between the advancing meniscus and the entrained film is where the fluid rheology has its greatest effect. The Oldroyd-B constitutive equation is used to model the viscoelastic fluid. The theory is formulated as a double expansion in Ca1 3 and We Ca1 3. According to our asymptotic analysis, as the fluid becomes more viscoelastic, the film thickness decreases and the pressure drop at the meniscus tip increases. A detailed analysis shows that the dominant mechanisms are the resistance to stream-wise strain, tending to lower the film thickness, and the buildup of shear stress, tending to raise the film thickness, with the former being the numerically larger of the two. Our theory leads to the prediction that as viscoelasticity comes to dominate the shear resistance, the film thickness will scale with U4 3. The effects of shear thinning and normal stress thinning are analyzed by adapting an approximate model obtained by retaining only the dominant terms in the force balance. Our Hele-Shaw cell theory is extended to dip coating and soap film forming flows. Our theoretical results pertaining to the effects of viscoelasticity on the thickness of the film are in qualitative agreement with recent experimental data. © 1995.},

   abstract = {Two-dimensional turbulence in flowing soap films with polymer additives is analyzed by image analysis. The power spectra of the interference patterns of turbulent soap films are calculated. The scaling exponent of the power spectrum is -5/3 for polymer free solution and -1 for dilute polymer solution in enstrophy cascade range, which is consistent with the results of thickness fluctuations in previous researches. We propose a Curvature analysis method that calculates the curvatures of the interference pattern of turbulent soap films. The results suggest that the curvature histogram describes well the shape of the interference pattern, which is related to the shape of the vortices. The curvature histograms for different polymer concentrations can be fitted by a stretched exponential function.},

The conformal invariance theory being tested here is related to the behavior of equilibrium systems near a critical point. This theory is associated with the work of L\"owner, Schramm and others and is usually referred to as Schramm-L\"owner Evolution (SLE). The system was exposed to several tests of SLE. The results of these tests suggest that zero-vorticity isolines exhibit noticeable departures from this type of conformal invariance.},

In its stationary state, the loop remains essentially motionless and its wake is a von Kármán vortex street. In its oscillatory state, the loop sheds two vortex dipoles, or more complicated vortical structures, within each oscillation period. We find that the oscillation frequency of the loop is linearly proportional to the flow velocity, and that the measured Strouhal numbers can be separated based on wake structure.},

   abstract = {Recent work in bio-fluid dynamics has studied the relation of fluiddrag to flow speed for flexible organic structures, such as tree leaves, seaweed, and coral beds, and found a reduction in drag growth due to body reconfiguration with increasing flow speed. Our theoretical and experimental work isolates the role of elasticbending in this process. Using a flexible glass fiber wetted into a vertical soap-film flow, we identify a transition in flow speed beyond which fluid forces dominate the elastic response, and yield large deformations of the fiber that greatly reduce drag. We construct free-streamline models that couple fluid and elastic forces and solve them in an efficient numerical scheme. Shape self-similarity emerges, with a scaling set by the balance of forces in a small “tip region” about the flow’s stagnation point. The result is a transition from the classical U 2 drag scaling of rigid bodies to a new U 4/3 drag law. We derive an asymptotic expansion for the fiber shape and flow, based on the length-scale of similarity. This analysis predicts that the fiber and wake are quasiparabolic at large velocities, and obtains the new drag law in terms of the drag on the tip region. Under variations of the model suggested by the experiment—the addition of flow tunnel walls, and a back pressure in the wake—the drag law persists, with a simple modification.},

   abstract = {There is a missing link between the macroscopic properties of turbulent flows(1-4), such as the frictional drag(5) of a wall-bounded flow, and the turbulent spectrum(1,6,7). The turbulent spectrum is a power law of exponent alpha (the 'spectral exponent') that gives the characteristic velocity of a turbulent fluctuation (or 'eddy') of size s as a function of s (ref. 1). Here we seek the missing link by comparing the frictional drag in soap-film flows(8), where alpha = 3 (refs 9,10), and in pipe flows(5), where alpha = 5/3 (refs 11,12). For moderate values of the Reynolds number Re, we find experimentally that in soap-film flows the frictional drag scales as Re-1/2, whereas in pipe flows the frictional drag scales(13) as Re-1/4. Each of these scalings may be predicted from the attendant value of a by using a new theory(14-16), in which the frictional drag is explicitly linked to the turbulent spectrum.},

   abstract = {Soap films were introduced to carry out classical hydrodynamics experiments on two-dimensional (2-D) flows by Couder [J. Phys. Lett. 42 (1981) 429-431] nearly two decades ago. The thickness of the film, ranging from 1 to 10 μm, varies slightly with the velocity field. This small thickness variation, however, results in fascinating color fringes, thus providing an excellent means for flow visualization. Here, a theoretical investigation is conducted to interpret the physical meaning of the color fringes that appear in soap film flows. It is shown that the color fringes resemble streamlines in the case of steady flow, under some domains of the parameter space. Also, photographs of flows over a circular cylinder and a backward-facing step taken in a horizontal soap film tunnel and numerical simulations under the same conditions of the experiments are presented. The color fringes shown in the photographs are in good agreement with numerically computed streamlines. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here we show experimentally that the velocity increases, peaks, drops abruptly, then lessens gradually downstream. We argue theoretically and verify experimentally that the abrupt drop in velocity corresponds to a Marangoni shock, a type of shock related to the elasticity of the film. Marangoni shocks induce locally intense turbulent fluctuations and may help elucidate the mechanisms that produce two-dimensional turbulence away from boundaries.},

Linear stability analysis of an idealized model of this flow predicts a critical Reynolds number R(c) is approximately equal to the square root of 2. In our soap film experiment, we find a critical value R(c) is approximately equal to 70. This discrepancy can be ascribed to frictional effects from viscous coupling of gas to the film, which is neglected in the idealized model. The kinematic viscosity of the surrounding gas and the thickness of gas layers on each side of the soap film are varied in the experiments to better understand these frictional effects. Our observations indicate that flow in the soap film cannot be decoupled from flow in the surrounding gas.},

Using an asymptotic analysis based upon the thinness of the film with respect to its lateral extent, evolution equations for the leading-order film thicknesses, transverse velocities and surfactant concentrations are obtained. Specializations to free and confined films of various geometries (planes, spheres, cylinders and catenoids) are presented, along with the results of stability analyses and numerical simulations. Similar techniques are applied to the analysis of the dynamics of a thin thread of liquid. For the special case of a two-dimensional free film without surfactants, the existence of a similarity solution near the point of rupture is considered. Finally, the motion of a general two-dimensional Stokes flow confined to a channel is studied. By performing a matched asymptotic analysis in the vicinity of the contact line, appropriate macroscopic boundary conditions are obtained. A coupled system of first-order ordinary differential equations which describe the evolution of the leading-order film surface allows for the numerical simulation of the flow.},

   abstract = {Thin liquid films are ubiquitous in nature and technology so an understanding of their mechanics is important in many applications. A typical thin film flow consists of an expanse of liquid partially bounded by a solid substrate with a (free) surface where the liquid is exposed to another fluid (usually a gas and most often air in applications). Typically, the thickness, H, in one direction is much smaller than the characteristic length scale, L, in the other directions and the flow takes place predominantly in the direction of one of the longer dimensions under the action of an external forcing (e.g., gravity, surface tension gradients, a rotating substrate). A simple and obvious example is the flow of a (thin) raindrop down a windowpane under the action of gravity. Typically, the flow velocity in directions perpendicular to the substrate (i.e., the window-pane) is much smaller than the main flow velocity along the windowpane. The most correct approach to modeling such flows is via the macroscopic momentum equation (e.g., the Stokes or Navier Stokes equations in the case of a Newtonian liquid) and this approach invariably involves detailed numerical computation e.g., Refs.1, 2. The approach taken here will be to exploit the existence of the small aspect ratio (? H/L) to expand the momentum equations in a perturbation series in powers of ?. In doing so we will be developing a so-called thin film or long wave approximation3 with the advantage that analytic solutions will often be possible and where this is not feasible, the reduced numerical problem will be greatly simplified.4 The approximation has much in common with classical lubrication theory5, 6 and is thus also referred to as the lubrication approximation. The success of this approximation is well documented in the literature and a feature of this success is its robustness9 and a tendency for it to deliver good results (in agreement with experiment) in parameter regimes on the outer limits of the expected range of validity or beyond. From a mathematical point of view, a typical complication associated with thin film flows is the fact that the free surface of the liquid is initially unknown and must be determined as part of the solution. In many practical thin film models surface tension plays a significant role.10 Even when formally small, surface tension often has a significant smoothing effect preventing the formation of shocks (sharp jumps in the film thickness). Mathematical models will be given here for flows on flat and curved surfaces including other effects such as gravity, compositional changes, and substrate energetics. Application areas include flow behavior of paints and other surface coatings, chemical, and nuclear reactor design, agrochemical applications, as well as several biofluid applications including thin films on the cornea and in the lungs. Asymptotic derivations of lubrication theory for 2-D problems with a free surface are given by Benney3 without surface tension and by Atherton and Homsy7 where surface tension is included. The thin film approximation can also be applied to non-Newtonian flows and there are many examples in the literature, e.g., Ref.8. This article is organized as follows: In The Idea Behind The Thin Film Approximation we discuss a particular (simple) problem to show how the thin film approximation is applied. Then we will discuss variations on the standard problem and more complicated situations. We then sketch a number of relevant examples in Examples Using Thin Film Models before making some closing remarks.},

   abstract = {Formation of Karman vortex streets by circular rods is studied in a flowing soap film channel. The two-dimensional fluid flow in the film allows stable vortex streets to be generated and studied over a broad range of Reynolds numbers, 10 < Re < 2000. There have been many studies of the Karman vortex streets. The current study focuses on the universal feature of the near-wake structures generated by circular cylinders in a uniform two-dimensional (2D) flow. The new approach in the investigation is to decompose the street into a series of vortex couples, which defines the outer envelope of the wake, and to study the expansion rate of these couples. Our experiment shows that motion of vortex couples are powered by bursts of transverse jets, and the jet intensity determines the asymptotic width and the expansion rate of the wake. A simple model is constructed that not only allows us to extract the kinetic energy encapsulated in the vortices but also explains the universal appearance of the 2D laminar wakes generated by large and small rods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the efficiency of energy injected into vortices is estimated and this efficiency turns out to be similar to 5%.

When a film is drawn\nfrom the reservoir to the water sheet, the surfactant molecules start\nmigrating from the former to the latter. To restore the thermodynamic\nequilibrium, the dragged film pulls more surfactant due to Marangoni\nelasticity, and thus a flow is established.

A new Immersed-Lattice Boltzmann Method (ILBM) scheme was used to study the effect of the gap spacing on the flow. The results show that the vortex shedding is suppressed as rotational speed increases. The flow reaches a steady state when the vortex shedding for both cylinders is completely suppressed at critical rotational speed. As the rotational speed further increases, the separation phenomenon in the boundary layers disappears at the attachment rotational speed. The critical rotational speed and attachment rotational speed become small as Reynolds number increases. The absolute rotational speed of cylinders should be large at same critical rotational speed and attachment rotational speed in the case of large Reynolds number. The gap spacing has an important role in changing the pattern of vortex shedding. It is very different in the mechanism of vortex shedding suppression for the flows around two rotating cylinders and single rotating cylinder. ?? 2009 Publishing House for Journal of Hydrodynamics.},

The experiments are carried out at Reynolds numbers, Re, of 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 and nondimensional rotation rates, α , varying from 0 to 5. The spacing ratios, T / D , are 1.8, 2.5, 4.0, and 7.5. Two possibilities of rotations are considered with the cylinder surfaces in between the two cylinders moving upstream in one case (inward rotation case) and downstream in the other (outward rotation case). The diagnostics is done by flow visualization using hydrogen bubble technique and quantitative measurements using particle imagevelocimetry(PIV). We present, using extensive flow visualization, the global view of the wake structure at Re of 200 for various rotation rates, and two senses. Vortex shedding suppression is studied through flow visualization and/or PIV at various Re’s, T / D ’s, and two senses. Vortex shedding is found to be suppressed in the inward rotation cases at all Re and T / D ’s. The value of α corresponding to vortex shedding suppression, α s , in the inward rotation case is ∼ 2.0 for Re of 200–500 at all T / D ’s. The value of α s for Re of 100 in the case of inward rotation shows an increasing trend with T / D from T / D = 1.8 to 4.0 with α s changing from 1.2 to 1.7; further increase of T / D does not change α s . For outward rotation cases, vortex shedding suppression is clearly observed for Re of 100 and for all values of T / D ; however, for higher Re, vortex shedding suppression is observed for T / D of 4.0 and 7.5 only. The measurements of α s in this case showed a decreasing trend with increasing T / D . Symmetry breaking is reported for inward rotation case near α = 1.35 for T / D = 2.5 at Re of 200 where the wake pattern changes from in-phase to antiphase mode.},

The spacing T between the cylinder axes was varied from 1.5d  to 3d (d is the cylinder diameter). Both cylinders were slightly heated.  A movable three-wire probe measured the velocity and temperature  fluctuations, and an X-wire provided a phase reference. Measurements  were conducted at x/d = 10, 20 and 40 at a Reynolds number of 5800  (based on d and the free-stream velocity U[infty infinity]). At T/d =  1.5, the phase-averaged velocity and temperature fields display a single  vortex street. The two rows of vortices exhibit a significant difference  in the maximum vorticity, size and lateral distance from the flow  centreline. As T/d is increased to 3.0, the flow is totally different.  Two antiphase streets occur initially. They are less stable, with  vortices weakening faster, than the street at T/d = 1.5. By x/d = 40,  one street only is identifiable. Effective vorticity flux density  indicates that, while the outer vortex nearer to the free stream  interacts largely with the adjacent oppositely signed inner vortices  located near the flow centreline, the inner vortex interacts with the  cross-stream inner vortices as well as with adjacent outer vortices. As  a result, vorticity associated with the inner vortex is annihilated  quicker than that associated with the outer vortex, leading to the early  disappearance of inner vortices and formation of a single street. The  contribution of the coherent motion of various Reynolds-averaged  quantities such as the momentum  and heat fluxes has also been  quantified and discussed in conjunction with the vortex  structures of  the flow and temperature fields.},

From instantaneous velocity and thickness fields, we find the vortex-shedding frequency, mean-flow velocity, and mean-film thickness. Using the empirical relationship between the Reynolds and Strouhal numbers obtained for cylinder wakes in three dimensions, we estimate the effective soap-film viscosity and its dependence on film thickness. We also compare the decay of vorticity with that in a simple Rankine vortex model with a dissipative term to account for air drag.},

Many aspects of this seemingly simple phenomenon remain unexplained. Of particular interest is the relationship between the dimensionless vortex shedding frequency (the Strouhal number St) and the ratio of inertial to viscous forces in the fluid (the Reynolds number Re). We propose a new St-Re relation based on the observations of the structure of a vortex street in flowing soap films. The measurements suggest a simple two-parameter form St=1/(A+B/Re) that describes laminar vortex shedding remarkably well for bulk fluids as well as for two-dimensional flowing soap films.},

We have previously reported scientific findings made with the apparatus, but never carefully described the technique, or its full potential. A brief introduction is given on the nature of soap films as fluids and then all the details necessary for creating robust flowing films are listed. Typical parameters for the system are: flow speeds from 0.5 to 4 m/s, film thickness between 1 and 10 μm, and typical film sizes are 3 m tall and 10 cm wide although films of 20 m tall and 4 m wide have also been made. A vacuum apparatus is also described in which the air drag on the film can be reduced by a factor of 5-10. Finally, a large number of techniques for measuring flow and thickness are outlined and referenced.},

The two-dimensional fluid flow in the film allows stable vortex streets to be generated and studied over a broad range of Reynolds numbers, 10 < Re < 2000. There have been many studies of the Karman vortex streets. The current study focuses on the universal feature of the near-wake structures generated by circular cylinders in a uniform two-dimensional (2D) flow. The new approach in the investigation is to decompose the street into a series of vortex couples, which defines the outer envelope of the wake, and to study the expansion rate of these couples. Our experiment shows that motion of vortex couples are powered by bursts of transverse jets, and the jet intensity determines the asymptotic width and the expansion rate of the wake. A simple model is constructed that not only allows us to extract the kinetic energy encapsulated in the vortices but also explains the universal appearance of the 2D laminar wakes generated by large and small rods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the efficiency of energy injected into vortices is estimated and this efficiency turns out to be similar to 5%.

   abstract = {The formation of soap films by vertical withdrawal from a bath is typically described by Frankel’s law, which assumes rigid film “walls” and shear-like dynamics. Since most soap films have interfaces that are not rigid, and as the flow in the withdrawal of thin free films is typically extensional, we reconsider the theory of soap film formation. By assuming extensional flow dominated by surface viscous stresses we find that the film thickness scales as the two-thirds power of the withdrawal speed U. This speed dependence is also predicted by Frankel’s law; the difference lies in the origin of the viscous resistance which sets the pre-factor. When bulk viscous stresses are important the speed dependence can vary between U2/3 and U2.},

When I was older, however, I visited the Fels Planetarium in Philadelphia and the Hayden Planetarium in New York, and that simple, self-centered perception was shattered. The drama and power of the dynamic universe overwhelmed me. 1 learned that single galaxies contain more stars than all the human beings who have ever lived, and I saw projections of clusters of such galaxies moving in the void of space like schools of fish swimming in the sea. The reality of the immensity and duration of the universe caused a kind of "existential shock" that shook the foundations of my being. Everything 1 had experienced or known seemed insignificant placed in that vast ocean of existence.},

   abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

   abstract = {Symmetry has always played an important role in mechanics, from fundamental formulations of basic principles to concrete applications. The theme of the book is to develop the basic theory and applications of mechanics with an emphasis on the role of symmetry. In recent times, the interest in mechanics, and in symmetry techniques in particular, has accelerated because of developments in dynamical systems, the use of geometric methods and new applications to integrable and chaotic systems, control systems, stability and bifurcation, and the study of specific rigid, fluid, plasma and elastic systems. Introduction to Mechanics and Symmetry lays the basic foundation for these topics and includes numerous specific applications, making it beneficial to physicists and engineers. This text has specific examples and applications showing how the theory works, and up-to-date techniques, all of which makes it accessible to a wide variety of readers, expecially senior undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics, physics and engineering. For this second edition, the text has been rewritten and updated for clarity throughout, with a major revamping and expansion of the exercises. Internet supplements containing additional material are also available on-line.},

   abstract = {Fifty years after the invention of the laser diode, and forty years after the butterfly effect signified the unpredictability of deterministic chaos, it is commonly believed that a laser diode behaves like a damped nonlinear oscillator and cannot be driven into chaotic operation without additional forcing or parameter modulation. Here, we counter that belief and report the first example of a free-running laser diode generating chaos. The underlying physics comprises a nonlinear coupling between two elliptically polarized modes in a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser. We identify chaos in experimental time series and show, theoretically, the bifurcations leading to single- and double-scroll attractors with characteristics similar to Lorenz chaos. The reported polarization chaos resembles noise-driven mode hopping, but shows opposite statistical properties. Our findings open up new research areas for the creation of controllable and integrated sources of optical chaos.},

It takes into account dynamics of the intersublevel coherence of the upper laser level. The model is suitable for modeling of He-Ne, He-Xe, CO2, and solid-state lasers. Nonlinear anisotropy of the gain medium in such an isotropic-cavity system favors either linearly or circularly polarized emission, that distinguishes two qualitatively different types of lasers. We have studied in detail, both analytically and numerically, impact of the vectorial degrees of freedom on selection of the polarization states, their stability, mechanisms of their destabilization, and symmetry properties of both types of weakly anisotropic lasers. Dominant role of the vector degrees of freedom in the development of laser instabilities is revealed. Two basic mechanisms of destabilization of the laser states, which are polarization amplitude and polarization phase mechanisms, are analytically distinguished. Among other phenomena our model predicts phenomena of polarization multistability, amplitude polarization chaos, quasiperiodic dynamics with scalar and vector incommensurate relaxation frequencies. Analytical treatment of the problem allowed us to generalize the polarization bad cavity limits to the case of anisotropic-cavity lasers. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

We devise a model of intermediate complexity which retains the dynamics of the atomic variables and which has the experimentally required linearly or circularly polarized steady state solutions with their relative stability near threshold depending on the difference of certain collisionally enhanced relaxation rates. Stability analysis of these steady states in this model provides second thresholds above which the polarization state is time dependent. The stable operation of polarized output states is interpreted in terms of coherence induced absorption or transparency even though the population inversion exceeds the lasing threshold on the transition which drives the orthogonally polarized field. A more general model of the field-atom dynamics than those previously considered is also constructed and analyzed for the stability of its steady states. The fundamental physical condition on the ratio of certain relaxation rates of previous models for stability of circular or linearly polarized solutions is unchanged. © 1995.},

   abstract = {The well-known switch of the polarization state of a Zeeman laser's emission into a single longitudinal mode as the cavity length is detuned is re-examined using a model that goes beyond third-order Lamb theory by retaining equations for the dynamics of the material variables for a J = 1 to J = 0 transition. For certain parameter values, the output of the laser as described by this model is predominantly two orthogonally polarized modes with different optical frequencies, as in third-order Lamb theories studied previously, but the more complicated field-material dynamics and near-threshold time-dependent solutions present in this model also give rise to more complicated pulsations and polarization dynamics as the cavity is detuned. Also as in third-order Lamb theories, in this model the preference (stability) for circularly or linearly polarized single mode emission depends on the ratio of the decay rates of the magnetic dipole and the electric quadrupole of the J = 1 level. For conditions in which the cross-saturation preference is for linearly polarized emission and there are weak linear anisotropies, the switching of the polarization state as the cavity is detuned has a range of overlap of the two polarization states (and corresponding time dependent dynamics) rather than the abrupt switching and hysteresis or polarization rotation more commonly found in simpler models. The detuning range for the overlap is sensitively dependent on the strength of the cross-saturation coupling. While there is similar exchange of relative dominance of two polarized modes when there is the combination of weak circular polarization anisotropies and cross-saturation preference for linearly polarized emission, the overlap region remains large, and it is relatively independent of the relaxation rate of the coherence between the upper levels. By comparing these results with experimental behavior found in a xenon laser which operates on a J = 3 → J = 2 transition we can estimate the effective parameters of the model suitable for describing certain features of this experimental situation, even though the xenon laser is known to have its preference for linearly polarized emission arise directly in the field-matter interaction rather than solely from relaxation rate differences as it does in the model considered here. © 1995.},

   abstract = {This paper is about mode interaction in systems of coupled nonlinear oscillators. The main ideas are demonstrated by means of a model consisting of two coupled, parametrically driven pendulums. On the basis of this we also discuss mode interaction in the Faraday experiment (as observed by Ciliberto and Gollub) and in running animals. In all these systems the interaction between two modes is seen to take place via a third mode: This interaction mode is a common daughter, born by means of a symmetry breaking bifurcation, of the two interacting modes. Thus, not just any two modes can interact with each other, but only those that are linked (in the system’s group-theoretical hierarchy) by a common daughter mode. This is the quintessence of mode interaction. In many cases of interest, the interaction mode is seen to undergo further bifurcations, and this can eventually lead to chaos. These stages correspond to lower and lower levels of symmetry, and the constraints imposed by group theory become less and less restrictive. Indeed, the precise sequence of events during these later stages is determined not so much by group-theoretical stipulations as by the accidental values of the nonlinear terms in the equations of motion.},

In the context of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space students can learn how to prepare a specific quantum state starting from an arbitrary state, issues related to the time evolution of the wave function and quantum measurement. The Stern–Gerlach experiment can also be used to teach the distinction between the physical space where the experiment is performed and the Hilbert space where the state of the system lies, and how information about the state of the system in the Hilbert space can be exploited to interpret the possible outcomes of the experiment in physical space. Students can learn the advantages of choosing an appropriate basis to make predictions about the outcomes of experiments with different arrangements of Stern–Gerlach devices. The latter can also help students understand that an ensemble of identically prepared systems is not the same as a mixture. We discuss student difficulties with the Stern–Gerlach experiment based on written tests and interviews with advanced undergraduate and graduate students in quantum mechanics courses. We also discuss preliminary data which suggest that the Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial on the Stern–Gerlach experiment is helpful in improving student understanding of these concepts.},

The novel idea of the experiment is to use very small oscillation amplitudes of the wire to avoid nonlinearities in the interaction. We achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio using a lock-in technique. We find quantitative agreement between theory and experiment for not only a mono- and a diatomic chain, but also for the bare wire. The latter agreement is the crucial aspect that distinguishes our experiment from previous ones. This agreement assures that the fundamental assumption of the theory (Hooke’s law) is satisfied. We show that the properties of phonon dispersion curves are not special, and that the same band structures occur when the wavelength of any wave becomes comparable to the length scale of a discrete periodicity.},

Exactly at R(0)?Rc , the turbulence evolves with constant Reynolds number and the energy decays as t?1 and the enstrophy as t?2.A t?2 decay law for the enstrophy was originally predicted by Batchelor for large Reynolds numbers ?Phys.

Numerical simulations are then performed for a wide range of initial Reynolds numbers with R(0)?Rc to study whether a universal power-law decay for the energy and enstrophy exist as t→?.

In the presence of linear drag, the energy wave-number spectrum drops with a power law faster than in the case without drag, and the vorticity field becomes intermittent, as shown by the anomalous scaling of the vorticity structure functions. Using previous theory, we compare numerical simulation results with predictions for the power law exponent of the energy wave-number spectrum and the scaling exponents of the vorticity structure functions zeta(2q). We also study, both by numerical experiment and theoretical analysis, the multifractal structure of the viscous enstrophy dissipation in terms of its Rényi dimension spectrum D(q). We derive a relation between D(q) and zeta(2q), and discuss its relevance to a version of the refined similarity hypothesis. In addition, we obtain and compare theoretically and numerically derived results for the dependence on separation r of the probability distribution of delta(r)omega, the difference between the vorticity at two points separated by a distance r. Our numerical simulations are done on a 4096 x 4096 grid.},

Since most soap films have interfaces that are not rigid, and as the flow in the withdrawal of thin free films is typically extensional, we reconsider the theory of soap film formation. By assuming extensional flow dominated by surface viscous stresses we find that the film thickness scales as the two-thirds power of the withdrawal speed U. This speed dependence is also predicted by Frankel’s law; the difference lies in the origin of the viscous resistance which sets the pre-factor. When bulk viscous stresses are important the speed dependence can vary between U2/3 and U2.},

   abstract = {Two rigid plates are vertically suspended by thread such that they are parallel to and opposite each other. The plates are partially submerged in a dish of liquid that is attached to the top of a vertical shake table. When the shake table is driven with noise in a frequency band, random surface waves are parametrically excited, and the plates move toward each other. The reason for this attraction is that the waves carry momentum, and the wave motion between the plates is visibly reduced. The behavior is analogous to the Casimir effect, in which two conducting uncharged parallel plates attract each other due to the zero-point spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. The water wave analog can be readily demonstrated and offers a visual demonstration of a Casimir-type effect. Measurements of the force agree with the water wave theory even at large wave amplitudes, where the theory is expected to break down. The water wave analog applies to side-by-side ships in a rough sea and is distinct from the significant attraction that can be caused by a strong swell.},

One method employs the notion of the space charge in the vacuum tube diode as described by the Child-Langmuir equation; the other method uses the electron trajectories in vacuum tube pentodes with cylindrical electrodes under conditions of orthogonally related electric and magnetic fields (the Hull magnetron method). The vacuum diode method gave e/m(e)=1.782 +/- 0.166x10(+11) C/kg (averaged over the vacuum diodes studied), and the Hull magnetron method gave e/m(e)=1.779 +/- 0.208x10(+11) C/kg (averaged over both pentodes and the anode voltages studied). These methods afford opportunities for students to determine the e/m(e) ratio without using the Bainbridge tube method and to become familiar with phenomena not normally covered in a typical experimental methods curriculum.},

   abstract = {We report results of a theoretical study of the adsorption of mixtures of ionic and nonionic surfactants at the aqueous solution-air interface. A surface equation of state is developed by treating the adsorbed surfactant molecules as a two-dimensional gaslike monolayer consisting of hard disks interacting through attractive van der Waals interactions and repulsive electrostatic interactions, The hard-disk areas are calculated using known bond lengths and angles in the case of surfactants having compact hydrophilic heads and a Monte Carlo simulation approach in the case of surfactants having flexible, polymer-like hydrophilic heads. Attractive van der Waals interactions between the surfactant hydrocarbon tails are treated as a purturbation to the hard-disk repulsions using an expansion in surfactant surface concentration truncated at second order. The corresponding second-order virial coefficients are calculated using detailed molecular information about the surfactant species present in the monolayer, Electrostatic interactions are assumed to form an additive contribution to the surface pressure and are calculated in the context of the Poisson-Boltzmann model distribution for the ions present in the aqueous phase. The resulting surface equation of state for the surfactant mixture is therefore molecularly based and does not contain experimentally determined parameters. We utilize this theoretical surface equation of state, along with a recently developed theoretical description of the bulk mixed surfactant solution behavior, to predict the mixed surfactant solution-air surface tension and surface concentration and composition as a function of the total bulk surfactant concentration and solution composition, both below and above the critical micelle concentration of the surfactant mixture. We also compare these theoretical predictions to available experimentally measured surface tensions of single surfactant aqueous solutions of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), dodecyl maltoside (C(12)Maltoside), and dodecyl hexa(ethylene oxide) (C12E6), as well as of binary surfactant aqueous solutions of SDS- C(12)Maltoside and SDS-C12E6. The predicted adsorbed surfactant surface concentration and composition for the SDS- C(12)Maltoside mixture are also compared to available experimentally measured values obtained recently using neutron scattering. In all cases, the theoretical predictions are found to be in good agreement with the experimental values.},

In this paper we show that symmetry-increasing bifurcation in the discrete dynamics of symmetric mappings is possible (and is perhaps generic). The reason for these bifurcations may be understood as follows. The existence of one attractor in a system with symmetry gives rise to a family of conjugate attractors all related by symmetry. Typically, in computer experiments, what we see is a sequence of symmetry-breaking bifurcations leading to the existence of conjugate chaotic attractors. As the bifurcation parameter is varied these attractors grow in size and merge leading to a single attractor having greater symmetry. We prove a theorem suggesting why this new attractor should have greater symmetry and present a number of striking examples of the symmetric patterns that can be formed by iterating the simplest mappings on the plane with the symmetry of the regular m-gon. In the last section we discuss period-doubling in the presence of symmetry. ?? 1988.},

   abstract = {In this paper we provide a connection between the geometrical properties of the attractor of a chaotic dynamical system and the distribution of extreme values. We show that the extremes of so-called physical observables are distributed according to the classical generalised Pareto distribution and derive explicit expressions for the scaling and the shape parameter. In particular, we derive that the shape parameter does not depend on the chosen observables, but only on the partial dimensions of the invariant measure on the stable, unstable, and neutral manifolds. The shape parameter is negative and is close to zero when high-dimensional systems are considered. This result agrees with what was derived recently using the generalized extreme value approach. Combining the results obtained using such physical observables and the properties of the extremes of distance observables, it is possible to derive estimates of the partial dimensions of the attractor along the stable and the unstable directions of the flow. Moreover, by writing the shape parameter in terms of moments of the extremes of the considered observable and by using linear response theory, we relate the sensitivity to perturbations of the shape parameter to the sensitivity of the moments, of the partial dimensions, and of the Kaplan–Yorke dimension of the attractor. Preliminary numerical investigations provide encouraging results on the applicability of the theory presented here. The results presented here do not apply for all combinations of Axiom A systems and observables, but the breakdown seems to be related to very special geometrical configurations.},

   abstract = {We present three examples of delayed bifurcations for spike solutions of reaction-diffusion systems. The delay effect results as the system passes slowly from a stable to an unstable regime, and was previously analyzed in the context of ODE's in Mandel and Erneux (1987). It was found that the instability would not be fully realized until the system had entered well into the unstable regime. The bifurcation is said to have been "delayed" relative to the threshold value computed directly from a linear stability analysis. In contrast to the study of Mandel and Erneux, we analyze the delay effect in systems of partial differential equations (PDE's). In particular, for spike solutions of singularly perturbed generalized Gierer-Meinhardt and Gray-Scott models, we analyze three examples of delay resulting from slow passage into regimes of oscillatory and competition instability. In the first example, for the Gierer-Meinhardt model on the infinite real line, we analyze the delay resulting from slowly tuning a control parameter through a Hopf bifurcation. In the second example, we consider a Hopf bifurcation of the Gierer-Meinhardt model on a finite one-dimensional domain. In this scenario, as opposed to the extrinsic tuning of a system parameter through a bifurcation value, we analyze the delay of a bifurcation triggered by slow intrinsic dynamics of the PDE system. In the third example, we consider competition instabilities triggered by the extrinsic tuning of a feed rate parameter. In all three cases, we find that the system must pass well into the unstable regime before the onset of instability is fully observed, indicating delay. We also find that delay has an important effect on the eventual dynamics of the system in the unstable regime. We give analytic predictions for the magnitude of the delays as obtained through the analysis of certain explicitly solvable nonlocal eigenvalue problems (NLEP's). The theory is confirmed by numerical solutions of the full PDE systems.},

   abstract = {Semiconductor lasers with continuous-wave optical injection display a rich variety of behaviors, including stable locking, periodic or chaotic oscillations, excitable pulses, etc. Within the chaotic regime it has been shown that the laser intensity can display extreme pulses, which have been identified as optical rogue waves (RWs), and it has also been shown that such extreme pulses can be completely suppressed via direct modulation of the laser current, with appropriated modulation amplitude and frequency. Here we perform a numerical analysis of the RW statistics and show that, when RWs are not suppressed by current modulation, their probability of occurrence strongly depends on the phase of the modulation. If the modulation is slow (the modulation frequency, f(mod), is below the relaxation oscillation frequency, f(ro)), the RWs occur within a well-defined interval of values of the modulation phase, i.e., there is a "safe" window of phases where no RWs occur. The most extreme RWs occur for modulation phases that are at the boundary of the safe window. When the modulation is fast (f(mod) > f(ro)), there is no safe phase window; however, the RWs are likely to occur at particular values of the modulation phase. Our findings are of interest for the study of RWs in other systems, where a similar response to external forcing could be observed, and we hope that they will motivate experimental investigations to further elucidate the role of the modulation phase in the likelihood of the occurrence of RWs.},

@article{Bodai2015,
   abstract = {In a low-order model of the general circulation of the atmosphere we examine the predictability of threshold exceedance events of certain observables. The likelihood of such binary events-the cornerstone also for the categoric (as opposed to probabilistic) prediction of threshold exceedances-is established from long time series of one or more observables of the same system. The prediction skill is measured by a summary index of the ROC curve that relates the hit- and false alarm rates. Our results for the examined systems suggest that exceedances of higher thresholds are more predictable; or in other words: rare large magnitude, i.e., extreme, events are more predictable than frequent typical events. We find this to hold provided that the bin size for binning time series data is optimized, but not necessarily otherwise. This can be viewed as a confirmation of a counterintuitive (and seemingly contrafactual) statement that was previously formulated for more simple autoregressive stochastic processes. However, we argue that for dynamical systems in general it may be typical only, but not universally true. We argue that when there is a sufficient amount of data depending on the precision of observation, the skill of a class of data-driven categoric predictions of threshold exceedances approximates the skill of the analogous model-driven prediction, assuming strictly no model errors. Therefore, stronger extremes in terms of higher threshold levels are more predictable both in case of data- and model-driven prediction. Furthermore, we show that a quantity commonly regarded as a measure of predictability, the finite-time maximal Lyapunov exponent, does not correspond directly to the ROC-based measure of prediction skill when they are viewed as functions of the prediction lead time and the threshold level. This points to the fact that even if the Lyapunov exponent as an intrinsic property of the system, measuring the instability of trajectories, determines predictability, it does that in a nontrivial manner.},

Although considerable effort has been directed towards understanding the physics behind these mysterious and potentially destructive events, the complete picture remains uncertain. Furthermore, rogue waves have not yet been observed in other physical systems. Here, we introduce the concept of optical rogue waves, a counterpart of the infamous rare water waves. Using a new real-time detection technique, we study a system that exposes extremely steep, large waves as rare outcomes from an almost identically prepared initial population of waves. Specifically, we report the observation of rogue waves in an optical system, based on a microstructured optical fibre, near the threshold of soliton-fission supercontinuum generation--a noise-sensitive nonlinear process in which extremely broadband radiation is generated from a narrowband input. We model the generation of these rogue waves using the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation and demonstrate that they arise infrequently from initially smooth pulses owing to power transfer seeded by a small noise perturbation.},

These dragon-kings reveal the existence of mechanisms of self-organization that are not apparent otherwise from the distribution of their smaller siblings. We present a generic phase diagram to explain the generation of dragon-kings and document their presence in six different examples (distribution of city sizes, distribution of acoustic emissions associated with material failure, distribution of velocity increments in hydrodynamic turbulence, distribution of financial drawdowns, distribution of the energies of epileptic seizures in humans and in model animals, distribution of the earthquake energies). We emphasize the importance of understanding dragon-kings as being often associated with a neighborhood of what can be called equivalently a phase transition, a bifurcation, a catastrophe (in the sense of Rene Thom), or a tipping point. The presence of a phase transition is crucial to learn how to diagnose in advance the symptoms associated with a coming dragon-king. Several examples of predictions using the derived log-periodic power law method are discussed, including material failure predictions and the forecasts of the end of financial bubbles.},

   abstract = {In mechanical treatment carried out by ball milling, powder particles are subjected to repeated high-energy mechanical loads which induce heavy plastic deformations together with fracturing and cold-welding events. Owing to the continuous defect accumulation and interface renewal, both structural and chemical transformations occur. The nature and the rate of such transformations have been shown to depend on variables, such as impact velocity and collision frequency that depend, in turn, on the whole dynamics of the system. The characterization of the ball dynamics under different impact conditions is then to be considered a necessary step in order to gain a satisfactory control of the experimental set up. In this paper we investigate the motion of a ball in a milling device. Since the ball motion is governed by impulsive forces acting during each collision, no analytical expression for the complete ball trajectory can be obtained. In addition, mechanical systems exhibiting impacts are strongly nonlinear due to sudden changes of velocities at the instant of impact. Many different types of periodic and chaotic impact motions exist indeed even for simple systems with external periodic excitation forces. We present results of the analysis on the ball trajectory, obtained from a suitable numerical model, under growing degree of impact elasticity. A route to high dimensional chaos is obtained. Crisis and attractors merging are also found. (c) 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

In this paper we develop a numerical technique which restricts orbits to the boundary. We call these numerically obtained orbits "straddle orbits". By following straddle orbits we can obtain all the basic sets on a basin boundary. Furthermore, we show that knowledge of the basic sets provides essential information on the structure of the boundaries. The straddle orbit method is illustrated by two systems as examples. The first system is a damped driven pendulum which has two basins of attraction separated by a fractal basin boundary. In this case the basic set is chaotic and appears to resemble the product of two Cantor sets. The second system is a high-dimensional system (five phase space dimensions), namely, two coupled driven Van der Pol oscillators. Two parameter sets are examined for this system. In one of these cases the basin boundaries are not fractal, but there are several attractors and the basins are tangled in a complicated way. In this case all the basic sets are found to be unstable periodic orbits. It is then shown that using the numerically obtained knowledge of the basic sets, one can untangle the topology of the basin boundaries in the five-dimensional phase space. In the case of the other parameter set, we find that the basin boundary is fractal and contains at least two basic sets one of which is chaotic and the other quasiperiodic. ?? 1988.},

For systems with bounded fluctuations, lambda-1 > 0 is the defining feature of chaos. Thus our procedures can be used to examine time series data for evidence of chaotic dynamics. We show that a consistent estimator of the partial derivatives of the autoregression function can be used to obtain a consistent estimator of lambda-1. The rate of convergence we establish is quite slow; a better rate of convergence is derived heuristically and supported by simulations. Simulation results from several implementations- one "local" (thin-plate splines) and three "global" (neural nets, radial basis functions, and projection pursuit)-am presented for two deterministic chaotic systems. Local splines and neural nets yield accurate estimates of the Lyapunov exponent; however, the spline method is sensitive to the choke of the embedding dimension. Limited results for a noisy system suggest that the thin-plate spline and neural net regression methods also provide reliable values of the Lyapunov exponent in this case.},

An extension of the uniform field limit is introduced, and a set of modal differential equations is derived that is solved with conventional numerical methods. The solutions show evidence of transvers mode competition in the laser dynamics, leading to both time-dependent and multimode stationary (cooperative frequency-locking) behaviors. In the time-dependent regime the resulting spatial structures are analyzed, and a scheme for the investigation and characterization of spatial complexity is suggested.},

Lyapunov exponents quantify the exponential divergence of initially close state-space trajectories and estimate the amount of chaos in a system. We present a new method for calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent from an experimental time series. The method follows directly from the definition of the largest Lyapunov exponent and is accurate because it takes advantage of all the available data. We show that the algorithm is fast, easy to implement, and robust to changes in the following quantities: embedding dimension, size of data set, reconstruction delay, and noise level. Furthermore, one may use the algorithm to calculate simultaneously the correlation dimension. Thus, one sequence of computations will yield an estimate of both the level of chaos and the system complexity.},

   abstract = {The occurrence of sudden qualitative changes of chaotic dynamics as a parameter is varied is discussed and illustrated. It is shown that such changes may result from the collision of an unstable periodic orbit and a coexisting chaotic attractor. We call such collisions crises. Phenomena associated with crises include sudden changes in the size of chaotic attractors, sudden appearances of chaotic attractors (a possible route to chaos), and sudden destructions of chaotic attractors and their basins. This paper presents examples illustrating that crisis events are prevalent in many circumstances and systems, and that, just past a crisis, certain characteristic statistical behavior (whose type depends on the type of crisis) occurs. In particular the phenomenon of chaotic transients is investigated. The examples discussed illustrate crises in progressively higher dimension and include the one-dimensional quadratic map, the (two-dimensional) H??non map, systems of ordinary differential equations in three dimensions and a three-dimensional map. In the case of our study of the three-dimensional map a new route to chaos is proposed which is possible only in invertible maps or flows of dimension at least three or four, respectively. Based on the examples presented the following conjecture is proposed: almost all sudden changes in the size of chaotic attractors and almost all sudden destruction or creations of chaotic attractors and their basins are due to crises. ?? 1983.},

We study these phenomena by numerical integration of the Maxwell-Bloch equations for the transverse pattern of a single-longitudinal mode laser with spherical mirrors and cylindrically symmetric boundary conditions. The motion of the defects appears in the form of travelling waves in the angular direction. This motion reduces the correlation of the intensity fluctuations at spatially separated points. One and two defect patterns are periodic or quasiperiodic, respectively. More complex patterns involving many moving defects display both the loss of temporal correlation (chaos) and the loss of spatial correlation (turbulence). A key to the independent motion of the defects is the excitation of a sufficient number of higher order radial and angular modes. ?? 1992.},

A fin de dar claridad al texto, daremos las demostraciones bajo condiciones simples.  Se darán los métodos de resolución de ecuaciones y sistemas lineales a coeficientes constantes (tanto homogéneos como no homogéneos). Por otro lado, se discutirá la noción de diagrama de fases y su relación con la posibilidad de predicción del comportamiento de las soluciones sin conocer una formula analítica de las mismas. Se vera como son los diagramas de fases de sistemas lineales a coeficientes constantes de dimensión 2 y también para sistemas no lineales conservativos.

For many systems, all accessible points lie on stable manifolds of periodic points. A point x on the basic boundaryis a Wada point if every open neighborhood of x has a nonempty intersection with at least three different basins. We call the boundary of a basin a Wada basin boundary if all its points are Wada points. Our main goal is to have definitions and hypotheses for Wada basin boundaries that can be verified by computer. The basic notion “basin cell” will play a fundamental role in our results for numerical verifications. Assuming each accessible point on the boundary of a basin B is on the stable manifold of some periodic orbit, we show that ∂B is a Wada basin boundary if the unstable manifold of each of its accessible periodic orbits intersects at least three basins. In addition, we find conditions for basins B1, B2,…, BN (N≥3) to satisfy ∂B1 = ∂B2 = … = ∂BN. Our results provide numerically verifiable conditions guaranteeing that the boundary of a basin is a Wada basin boundary. Our examples make use of an existing numerical procedure for finding the accessible periodic points on the basin boundary and another procedure for plotting stable and unstable manifolds to verify the existence of Wada basin boundaries.},

   abstract = {Since the publication of "Spectral Methods in Fluid Dynamics", spectral methods, particularly in their multidomain version, have become firmly established as a mainstream tool for scientific and engineering computation. While retaining the tight integration between the theoretical and practical aspects of spectral methods that was the hallmark of the earlier book, Canuto et al. now incorporate the many improvements in the algorithms and the theory of spectral methods that have been made since 1988.The initial treatment Fundamentals in Single Domains discusses the fundamentals of the approximation of solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations on single domains by expansions in smooth, global basis functions. The first half of the book provides the algorithmic details of orthogonal expansions, transform methods, spectral discretization of differential equations plus their boundary conditions, and solution of the discretized equations by direct and iterative methods. The second half furnishes a comprehensive discussion of the mathematical theory of spectral methods on single domains, including approximation theory, stability and convergence, and illustrative applications of the theory to model boundary-value problems. Both the algorithmic and theoretical discussions cover spectral methods on tensor-product domains, triangles and tetrahedra. All chapters are enhanced with material on the Galerkin with numerical integration version of spectral methods. The discussion of direct and iterative solution methods is greatly expanded as are the set of numerical examples that illustrate the key properties of the various types of spectral approximations and the solution algorithms. A companion book "Evolution to Complex Geometries and Applications to Fluid Dynamics" contains an extensive survey of the essential algorithmic and theoretical aspects of spectral methods for complex geometries and provides detailed discussions of spectral algorithms for fluid dynamics in simple and complex geometries.},

This paper demonstrates that polynomial- based rules out-perform number-theoretic quadrature (Monte Carlo) rules both in terms of efficiency and accuracy. To show the impact a quadra- ture method can have on results, we examine the performance of these rules in the context of Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995)’s model of product differentiation, where Monte Carlo methods introduce consider- able numerical error and instability into the computations. These prob- lems include inaccurate point estimates, excessively tight standard errors, instability of the inner loop ‘contraction’ mapping for inverting market shares, and poor convergence of several state of the art solvers when com- puting point estimates. Both monomial rules and sparse grid methods lack these problems and provide a more accurate, cheaper method for quadrature. Finally, we demonstrate how researchers can easily utilize high quality, high dimensional quadrature rules in their own work.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

   abstract = {The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein's theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The presented programs are based on Blitz++ (C++), NumPy (Python) and Fortran's built-in array containers. The solvers constitute implementations of the Multidimensional Positive-Definite Advective Transport Algorithm (MPDATA). The introduced codes serve as examples for how the application of object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques and new language constructs from C++11 and Fortran 2008 allow to reproduce the mathematical notation used in the literature within the program code. A discussion on the tradeoffs of the programming language choice is presented. The main angles of comparison are code brevity and syntax clarity (and hence maintainability and auditability) as well as performance. All performance tests are carried out using free and open-source compilers. In the case of Python, a significant performance gain is observed when switching from the standard interpreter (CPython) to the PyPy implementation of Python.

For the laser alone, the only possible solution is constant intensity. However, the introduction of an external field, with an amplitude that does not satisfy the injection-locking condition, destabilizes the system. In such a case, numerical results show the existence of a self-Q-switching process, which induces relaxation oscillations. The frequency of the giant pulses is directly related to the amplitude of the external field, whereas the frequency of the relaxation oscillations depends on the damping rates. We show also that, depending on the value assigned to control parameters, the interaction between these frequencies leads to a chaotic behavior through intermittency or period-doubling bifurcations. Finally, topological equivalence between our laser system and a unidimensional circle map is shown for some values of control parameters.},

   abstract = {We consider three types of changes that attractors can undergo as a system parameter is varied.\nThe first type leads to the sudden destruction of a chaotic attractor. The second type leads to the\nsudden widening of a chaotic attractor. In the third type of change, which applies for many systems\nwith symmetries, two (or more) chaotic attractors merge to form a single chaotic attractor\nand the merged attractor can be larger in phase-space extent than the union of the attractors before\nthe change. All three of these types of changes are termed crises and are accompanied by a\ncharacteristic temporal behavior of orbits after the crisis. For the case where the chaotic attractor\nis destroyed, this characteristic behavior is the existence of chaotic transients. For the case where\nthe chaotic attractor suddenly widens, the characteristic behavior is an intermittent bursting out of\nthe phase-space region within which the attractor was confined before the crisis. For the case\nwhere the attractors suddenly merge, the characteristic behavior is an intermittent switching between\nbehaviors characteristic of the attractors before merging. In all cases a time scale ~ can be\ndefined which quantifies the observed post-crisis behavior: for attractor destruction, ~ is the average\nchaotic transient lifetime; for intermittent bursting, it is the mean time between bursts; for intermittent\nswitching, it is the mean time between switches. The purpose of this paper is to examine\nthe dependence of ~ on a system parameter (call it p) as this parameter passes through its crisis\nvalue p =p, . Our main result is that for an important class of systems the dependence of ~ on p is r- ~ p —p, ~\nr for p close to p„and we develop a quantitative theory for the determination of the\ncritical exponent y. Illustrative numerical examples are given. In addition, applications to experimental\nsituations, as well as generalizations to higher-dimensional cases, are discussed. Since the\ncase of attractor destruction followed by chaotic transients has previously been illustrated with examples\n[C. Grebogi, E. Ott, and J. A. Yorke, Phys. Rev. Lett. 57, 1284 11986)], the numerical experiments\nreported in this paper will be for crisis-induced intermittency (i.e., intermittent bursting\nand switching).},

Its variety of output formats, several chart types, and capability to run either interactively (from Python or IPython consoles) and non-interactively (useful, for example, when included into web applications), makes Matplotlib suitable for use in many different situations. Matplotlib is a big package with several dependencies and having them all installed and running properly is the first step that needs to be taken. We provide some ways to have a system ready to explore Matplotlib. Then we start describing the basic functions required for plotting lines, exploring any useful or advanced commands for our plots until we come to the core of Matplotlib: the object-oriented interface. This is the root for the next big section of the book—embedding Matplotlib into GUI libraries applications. We cannot limit it only to desktop programs, so we show several methods to include Matplotlib into web sites using low level techniques for two well known web frameworks—Pylons and Django. Last but not the least, we present a number of real world examples of Matplotlib applications. The core concept of the book is to present how to embed Matplotlib into Python applications, developed using the main GUI libraries: GTK+, Qt 4, and wxWidgets. However, we are by no means limiting ourselves to that. The step-by-step introduction to Matplotlib functions, the advanced details, the example with web frameworks, and several real-life use cases make the book suitable for anyone willing to learn or already working with Matplotlib.},

These bifurcations include sudden changes in the size and/or type of the set. An explosion is a bifurcation in which new recurrent points suddenly appear at a non-zero distance from any pre-existing recurrent points. We discuss the following. In a generic one-parameter family of dissipative invertible maps of the plane there are only four known mechanisms through which an explosion can occur: (1) a saddle-node bifurcation isolated from other recurrent points, (2) a saddle-node bifurcation embedded in the set of recurrent points, (3) outer homoclinic tangencies, and (4) outer heteroclinic tangencies. (The term "outer tangency" refers to a particular configuration of the stable and unstable manifolds at tangency.) In particular, we examine different types of tangencies of stable and unstable manifolds from orbits of pre-existing invariant sets. This leads to a general theory that unites phenomena such as crises, basin boundary metamorphoses, explosions of chaotic saddles, etc. We illustrate this theory with numerical examples.</p>},

Many examples of Lie groups and Lie algebras are given throughout the text, with appli- cations of the material to physical sciences and applied mathematics. The relation between Lie group theory and algorithms for solving ordinary differential equa- tions is presented and shown to be analogous to the relation between Galois groups and algorithms for solving polynomial equations. Other chapters are devoted to differential geometry, relativity, electrodynamics, and the hydrogen atom. Problems are given at the end of each chapter so readers can monitor their understanding of the materials.

It is particularly well suited for "stiff" differential systems, for which the backward differentiation formula method of orders 1 to 5 is provided. The code includes the Adams-Moulton method of orders 1 to 12; so it can be used for nonstiff problems as well. In addition, the user can easily switch methods to increase computational efficiency for problems that change character. For both methods a variety of corrector iteration techniques is included in the code. Also, to minimize computational work, both the step size and method order are varied dynamically. This report presents complete descriptions of the code and integration methods, including their implementation. It also provides a detailed guide to the use of the code, as well as an illustrative example problem.},

This particular example is chosen due to the natural transition to\nangular quadrature and extension to the integration of arbitrary three-dimensional functions; how-\never, the concepts discussed with the Gauss-Laguerre example are easily applied to Gauss-Hermite\nquadrature, for example, and its application to anharmonic oscillator problems.

These antiphase polarization domains include stable lattices of soliton trains with high duty cycle at repetition rates of hundreds of MHz, as well as sparse trains of coupled dark and bright solitary waves. © 2014 American Physical Society.},

Topics within relativity that fascinate astrophysical researchers and students alike are covered with Schutz's characteristic ease and authority - from black holes to gravitational lenses, from pulsars to the study of the Universe as a whole. This edition now contains discoveries by astronomers that require general relativity for their explanation; a revised chapter on relativistic stars, including new information on pulsars; an entirely rewritten chapter on cosmology; and an extended, comprehensive treatment of modern detectors and expected sources. Over 300 exercises, many new to this edition, give students the confidence to work with general relativity and the necessary mathematics, whilst the informal writing style makes the subject matter easily accessible.

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The local topology of the incompressible 2D flow is characterized by the Jacobian determinant \Lambda(x,y) = (\omega^2 - \sigma^2)/4, where \omega (x,y) is the local vorticity and \sigma (x,y) is the local strain rate. For turbulent flows driven by different external force configurations, P(\Lambda) is found to be a universal function when rescaled using the turbulent intensity. A simple model that agrees with the measured functional form of P(\Lambda) is constructed using the assumption that the stream function, \psi(x,y), is a Gaussian random field.},

@article{Zakharov1968,
   abstract = {We study the stability of steady nonlinear waves on the surface of an infinitely deep fluid [1, 2]. In section 1, the equations of hydrodynamics for an ideal fluid with a free surface are transformed to canonical variables: the shape of the surface η(r, t) and the hydrodynamic potential ψ(r, t) at the surface are expressed in terms of these variables. By introducing canonical variables, we can consider the problem of the stability of surface waves as part of the more general problem of nonlinear waves in media with dispersion [3,4]. The resuits of the rest of the paper are also easily applicable to the general case. In section 2, using a method similar to van der Pohl's method, we obtain simplified equations describing nonlinear waves in the small amplitude approximation. These equations are particularly simple if we assume that the wave packet is narrow. The equations have an exact solution which approximates a periodic wave of finite amplitude. In section 3 we investigate the instability of periodic waves of finite amplitude. Instabilities of two types are found. The first type of instability is destructive instability, similar to the destructive instability of waves in a plasma [5, 6], In this type of instability, a pair of waves is simultaneously excited, the sum of the frequencies of which is a multiple of the frequency of the original wave. The most rapid destructive instability occurs for capillary waves and the slowest for gravitational waves. The second type of instability is the negative-pressure type, which arises because of the dependence of the nonlinear wave velocity on the amplitude; this results in an unbounded increase in the percentage modulation of the wave. This type of instability occurs for nonlinear waves through any media in which the sign of the second derivative in the dispersion law with respect to the wave number (d2ω/dk2) is different from the sign of the frequency shift due to the nonlinearity. As announced by A. N. Litvak and V. I. Talanov [7], this type of instability was independently observed for nonlinear electromagnetic waves.},
